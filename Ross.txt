1 Floor Area of the Store is less than the size specified in Section 1.3.3 (the "Agreed Size"), Minimum
2 Rent and all other charges shall be proportionately reduced and the parties shall set forth the actual
3 Leasable Floor Area of the Store, the adjusted Minimum Rent and other corrections necessitated by
4 the adjustment in Store size in the Acknowledgment of Commencement in Exhibit E hereto. In
5 the event that the Leasable Floor Area of the Store is more than the Agreed Size, Minimum Rent
6 and all other charges shall be based upon the Agreed Size. Nothing herein shall be construed as
7 permitting a material variance in dimensions or area. For purposes of this Section 3.7, a material
8 variance is any decrease in the amount of Store frontage set forth in Section 1.3.3 or any decrease in
9 the Agreed Size by more than one-half (1/2) of one percent (1 %) of the amount of square feet of
10 Leasable Floor Area. Landlord shall simultaneously provide to Tenant a certificate from the project
11 manager as to the total Leasable Floor Area in Landlord's Parcel depicted on Exhibit B. Tenant
12 shall have the right to dispute through its own licensed architect the amounts so represented and, if
13 so, any unresolved dispute shall be resolved as provided in Section 20.2. Until the amount of
14 Leasable Floor Area in the Store and in Landlord's Parcel has been finally determined, Tenant may
15 defer payment of Minimum Rent to the extent of the disputed amount and the disputed portion of
16 its pro rata share of any charges which require the use of Leasable Floor Area for computational
17 purposes under the terms of this Lease (e.g., Taxes, insurance and Common Area Charges).
18 3.8. Effect ofOEA.
19 (a) Landlord agrees that the use of all portions of the Shopping Center, and restrictions
20 upon such use, are material to this Lease and absent rights of usage (and restrictions upon usage),
21 Tenant would not have entered into this Lease. Therefore, Landlord grants to Tenant non-exclusive
22 easements, rights, licenses, privileges and servitudes reserved in, or granted by, the OEA for the
23 benefit of Landlord's Parcel including the area surrounding the Shopping Center if encumbered by
24 the OEA.
25 (b) Landlord agrees that all rights under the OEA requiring the approval, consent or
26 election exercisable by Landlord which would have a material effect on either (i) Tenant's use and
27 enjoyment of the Store; or (ii) Tenant's rights and obligations under this Lease, shall not be granted
28 or exercised by Landlord without the prior written consent of Tenant. Landlord further agrees that
29 Landlord shall not, as owner of the Landlord's Parcel, execute any documents terminating or
30 modifying the OEA if such modification would have a material effect on either (i) Tenant's use and
31 enjoyment of the Store or (ii) Tenant's rights and obligations under this Lease without the prior
32 written consent of Tenant.
33 (c) Landlord agrees that performance by the other parties to the OEA (the "Co-
34 parties"), in accordance with its terms, is material to this Lease; therefore Landlord agrees that to the
35 extent Landlord has control Landlord shall make commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Co-
36 parties to so perform, and if it does not, shall be in breach of this Lease. If following notice from
37 Tenant, Landlord does not commence such effort in time sufficient so that prosecution of such
38 efforts is not prejudiced by delay (and in any event, commence prosecution thereof within thirty (30)
39 days of notice from Tenant), Tenant may prosecute such efforts in its own name or Landlord's, but
40 in either event, with Landlord's full cooperation, and Landlord shall reimburse Tenant for all costs
41 in good faith incurred. So long as Landlord prosecutes such efforts, however, with the use of
42 commercially reasonable efforts, Landlord shall not have financial liability to Tenant by reason of
43 nonperformance of the OEA provisions by any Co-parties thereto, but if such nonperformance has
44 a material adverse effect upon Tenant's Store, such nonperfo1mance for purposes of this Lease shall
45 be considered a Casualty, and Tenant's rights shall be as they are in the case of a Casualty. Nothing

1 herein shall preclude a claim by Landlord or Tenant against such nonperfonning OEA party for
2 damages in the event of breach of the OEA thereby.
3 (d) Although the Store and the rights of Tenant under this Lease are necessarily subject
4 to the OEA the parties hereto agree that, as between the parties hereto, all provisions of this Lease
5 shall be superior and paramount to the OEA. In the event of any inconsistency between the OEA
6 and this Lease (i) as between the parties hereto, the provisions of this Lease shall prevail, and (ii) if
7 any right(s) of Tenant under this Lease are disturbed and/ or interfered with by any person claiming
8 through or under the OEA, the same shall be deemed a default by Landlord under this Lease,
9 including, without limitation, Article 18 hereof, and Tenant shall have all rights and remedies with
10 respect thereto as Tenant would have with respect to any other default by Landlord under this
11 Lease.
12 (e) Tenant agrees that it shall not violate the terms, covenants, conditions and
13 agreements set forth in the OEA which are of a prohibitory nature; the obligations imposed by the
14 OEA which are of an affirmative nature in respect of the Store shall be performed by Landlord
15 unless Tenant is obligated to perform such under a provision of this Lease.
16 (Â£) In the event Landlord grants approval to Tenant under any of the terms of this
17 Lease, it shall be deemed that Landlord has obtained all necessary approvals under the OEA.

22 such construction, remodeling, alteration or other work which are not caused by Tenant, its employees,
23 agents, contractors or Invitees, including but not limited to, claims for defective work. The obligations

1 Delivery Date and any work to the interior of the Major Tenant E Building that is performed thereafter

3 Requirements"). In the event that Landlord does not timely complete Landlord's Post Delivery
4 Construction Obligations or remove the Temporru.y Staging Area in accordance with the provisions of
5 this Section 5.1.1(b) then Tenant's entire obligation for Minimum Rent and Reimbursements shall be
6 replaced by Substitute Rent which shall be payable within fifteen (15) days after the close of each

10 the exterior of other buildings in the in the Inline Building, then Landlord shall be obligated to
11 similarly upgrade the exterior of the Building so that the Shopping Center presents a uniform
12 appearance of quality, design and age. Landlord's failure to meet the provisions of this Section 5.1 .2
13 within si..'<ty (60) days following the completion of the general upgrading of other buildings in the in
14 the Inline Building shall constitute a material default under the provisions of this Lease entitling
15 Tenant to all remedies at law, in equity and/or under the terms hereof.
16 5.2. Construction Commencement.
17 Subject to a Tenant Delay or delays caused by events of Force Majeure, if Landlord fails to
18 commence to perform Landlord's Construction Obligations, including the construction of the Store
19 prior to the date specified in Section 1.4.3 of the Lease ("Commencement of Construction"), then at
20 any time thereafter, but prior to commencement thereof, Tenant shall have the right to terminate
21 this Lease by notifying Landlord in writing. To commence construction means to commence
22 pouring the foundation for the Store.
23 5.3. Completion of Construction.
24 Landlord shall use commercially reasonable efforts to complete Landlord's Construction
25 Obligations and deliver possession of the Store to Tenant prior to the Intended Delivery Date.
26 5.4. Construction Completion Notice.
27 (a) The parties acknowledge the necessity for Landlord to provide Tenant
28 with the notice specified in this Section 5.4 in order that Tenant shall have adequate time to, among
29 other things, hire personnel, arrange promotion, purchase and delive1y of merchandise, perform
30 Tenant's improvements and fixturization of the Store and enter into other commitments required to
31 timely occupy and conduct business within the Store. Not less than one hundred twenty (120)
32 calendar days prior to the Delivery Date, Landlord must notify Tenant in writing as to when the
33 Delivery Date will occur (the "Construction Completion Notice") in the fonn set forth in Exhibit G
34 which must be on a Permitted Delivery Day. On or before the Delivery Date as specified in the

36 Landlord of the first date that Tenant intends to operate in the Store for retail business to the general
37 public (the "Opening Date Notice"); provided, however, in no event shall the Opening Date Notice
38 set forth an opening date that is earlier than eight (8) days after the date set forth in the Construction
39 Completion Notice. In the event Landlord does not timely deliver the Store as stated in the
40 Construction Completion Notice (subject to delays caused by events of Force Majeure or a Tenant
41 Delay), Tenant will suffer damages arising from Tenant's need for adequate and proper advance notice
42 of delivery. It would be impractical or extremely difficult to fix actual damages in the event of

1 Landlord's breach under this Section 5.4. Therefore, in the event of a breach by Landlord of its
2 obligations under this Section 5.4, the pati:i.es acknowledge that the damages to be suffered by Tenant
3 in such event are difficult to ascertain. However, after negotiation the pati:i.es have made their best
4 reasonable estimate of such damage and have agreed that Landlord shall pay to Tenant, as liquidated
5 damages (the "Liquidated Damages"), the sum of One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($150,000)
6 which sum shall be paid to Tenant in a lwnp sum by Landlord to Tenant upon Tenant's written
7 demand. Nothing herein shall prohibit Tenant, in addition to claiming the Liquidated Damages, from
8 postponing occupancy and the commencement of the payment of Rent as specified in Section 5.5
9 hereof. In the event Landlord fails to pay to Tenant the Liquidated Damages within thirty (30) days
10 from Landlord's receipt of written demand for payment as required by this Section, Tenant may, at its
11 option, deduct the full amount of the Liquidated Damages from the Rent or other charges coming due
12 until Tenant has fully recovered such amount. If Landlord fails to deliver the Store as stated in the
13 Construction Completion Notice solely due to a Tenant Delay or due to delays caused by an event of
14 Force Majeure, there shall be no Liquidated Damages on the account of Landlord's failure to meet the
15 Delivery Date set forth in the Construction Completion Notice. In addition, if Landlord fails to
16 deliver a Construction Completion Notice there shall be no Liquidated Damages payable by Landlord.
17 (b) In addition to the provisions of Section 5.4(a) above, if Tenant delivers an
18 Opening Date Notice to Landlord, and thereafter, Landlord fails to timely deliver the Store at least
19 eight (8) business days before the date set forth in the Opening Date Notice (other than due to an
20 event of Force Majeure or Tenant Delay), in addition to Tenant's rights and remedies set forth in this
21 Section and Sections 5.5, 5.7 and 5.8 due to a missed Delivery Date, Tenant shall also have the right to
22 occupy the Store without any obligation to pay Landlord Rent on and after the Commencement Date
23 (notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.1.1 of this Lease) for a period equal to the number of days
24 between the missed Delivery Date as specified in the Construction Completion Notice and the later of:
25 (i) the actual Delivery Date; or (ii) the first day of the next Pennitted Delivery Day.
26 (c) Landlord may deliver the Store to Tenant on other than a Pennitted
27 Delivery Day, however, Tenant shall be under no obligation to take delivery, or, if Tenant does take
28 delivery, to pay Rent or any other charges until the Commencement Date.
29 5.5. Rollover.
30 Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Lease, Tenant shall not be obligated to accept
31 delivery of the Store at any time other than on a Permitted Delivery Day nor at any time (whether or
32 not on a Permitted Delivery Day) if Landlord has failed to give notice in accordance with
33 Section 5.4(a) hereof. If (a) Landlord offers to deliver the Store to Tenant on a date other than a
34 Permitted Delivery Day and Tenant does not accept delivery of the Store on such date, or
35 (b) Landlord fails to deliver a timely Construction Completion Notice to Tenant, or (c) Landlord
36 delivers a Construction Completion Notice to Tenant and thereafter Landlord fails to timely deliver
37 the Store to Tenant then, the Delivery Date shall, at Tenant's option, be deferred ("Rollover") until
38 the next Permitted Delivery Day which occurs or is in effect after the one hundred twentieth (120th)
39 day following the Landlord noticed Delivery Date. Tenant's rights to Rollover the Delivery Date

16 Completion Notice. Tenant agrees that it shall not materially interfere with the progress of

18 general contractor. No such entry by Tenant shall be deemed an acceptance of the Store. Tenant
19 may use such utilities as are available during the course of such period at no charge or cost to

21 obligations set forth in Section 14.1 and Tenant's insurance obligations set forth in Section 9.2.1

28 list ("Punchlist") containing all items which were identified during the Walk-Through Inspection
29 (a) to the extent necessary to permit Tenant to commence Tenant's Work without material
30 interference from Landlord's contractor performing Landlord's Work, and (b) Tenant's retail
31 operations to commence in the Store without impediment to the conduct thereof by the incomplete
32 nature of Landlord's Work and (c) including completion of the Common Areas to the extent
33 required by this Lease. If Tenant does submit such a list, and the items set forth on the list are, in

34 Shopping Center, as applicable; (38) premiums for earthquake, flood or terrorism insurance of any
35 kind; (39) costs for the construction and maintenance of any pylon or monument signs for the

1 year (except if the Shopping Center has not been operated for one (1) year or more as of the
2 Commencement Date of the Term, Common Area Charges shall be based on Landlord's reasonable
3 estimate thereof based on typical charges for similar shopping centers within five (5) miles of the
4 Shopping Center), and Landlord shall so inform Tenant of such projections in writing along with the
5 Annual Statement referred to below. Beginning with the first (1st) day of the first calendar month
6 of the Term following Tenant's receipt of Landlord's written estimate of its annual obligation in
7 respect of Common Area Charges (but not in any event before thirty (30) days after receipt thereof),
8 Tenant shall include one-twelfth (1/12th) of its annual obligations set forth in such estimate with
9 each payment of Minimum Rent for the ensuing twelve (12) month period. After the first calendar
10 year, any proposed increase in total Common Area Charges in excess of three percent (3%) over the
11 previous year's expenditures must be justified by itemization of each element of charge, together
12 with (a) a written explanation of the reason (i.e., increased scope of work, deferred work, etc.) for
13 the increase in excess of three percent (3%), and (b) copies of the competitive bids described in
14 Section 7.4.3 below. The requirement for bids shall also apply at any time an element of the
15 Common Area Charge is proposed to increase more than ten percent (10%) in any year, in relation
16 to the cost for such element for the previous twelve (12) months, whether the resulting proposed
17 Common Area Charges for the subject year will be in excess of one hundred three percent (103%)
18 of the amount paid by Tenant for the previous twelve (12) months. In the absence of the required
19 justification of the proposed increase in Common Area Charges in excess of three percent (3%),
20 Tenant shall be under no obligation in respect of such year to pay more than one hundred three
21 percent (103%) of the amount payable by Tenant for the previous twelve (12) months. In the event
22 Landlord fails to maintain the Common Area as specified in Section 7.1.1. above, and fails to cure
23 such failure within ten (10) days following written notice thereof from Tenant, Tenant shall have the
24 right to defer paying its Pro Rata Share of the Common Area Charges until Landlord resumes
25 maintaining the Common Area as required by this Lease.
26 7.4.3. Landlord's Contracts. All Landlord's contracts with third parties for work,
27 service or materials, the cost of which may be included in the Common Area Charges, shall include
28 a detailed description of the work, service, or material to be provided by the contractor. No such
29 contracts shall involve a duplication of the work or service provided by other contractors, their
30 employees or agents or the employees of Landlord. Landlord shall maintain detailed job
31 descriptions for all employees employed by Landlord for the purpose of performing Common Area
32 maintenance activities whose salaries, wages and/ or benefits may be included in Common Area
33 Charges. Landlord's employees shall not provide duplicate services to those provided by Landlord's
34 third party contractors. All third party contracts in excess of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000) shall
35 be awarded by competitive bidding from at least two (2) bona fide third party contractors.
36 7.4.4. Fast Food Restaurant Costs. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
37 contained in this Article 7, in computing the amount of Tenant's obligation to pay Common Area
38 Charges, the ratable share of any fast food restaurant occupying a portion of the Shopping Center
39 for expenses of sweeping, cleaning, and removing debris in the Common Area shall be double the
40 share such restaurant would have paid assuming a numerator equal to the Leasable Floor Area in the
41 restaurant and a denominator equal to the Leasable Floor Area of the Shopping Center. As a
42 hypothetical example and for illustration purposes only, if },,_ryz Burgers operates a three thousand
43 (3,000) square foot restaurant in the Shopping Center, XYZ Burgers' share of Common Area
44 Charges shall be computed as if XYZ Burgers occupied six thousand (6,000) square feet. The
45 amount contributed by XYZ Burgers toward Common Area Charges shall then be deducted &om
46 the total Common Area Charges for purposes of establishing the amount of Tenant's Pro Rata

Share of Common Area Charges. Tenant's Pro Rata Share of Common Area Charges shall have the
denominator reduced by the fast food restaurant's Leasable Floor Area, in this case three thousand
(3,000) square feet, and the result shall be the amount of Tenant's obligation to pay Common Area
Charges. Such method of calculation shall be utilized for all fast food restaurants in the Shopping
Center. For purposes of this Lease, a "fast food" restaurant is defined as a tenant whose primary
business is the sale of counter, drive-up, and/ or the drive-through sale of food items for on or offpremises
consumption (e.g., McDonald's, Burger King, Pizza Hut, KFC, etc.); provided, however,
that the foregoing provisions shall not apply to fast food or other restaurants located on Outparcels
1 through 6 (as identified on the Site Plan) which, pursuant to the OEA, shall be separately
maintained at the sole expense of the owners of each such Outparcel and are obligated for the
Outparcel CAM Contribution described in Section 7.2.2.
7.4.5. Annual Statement. Within ninety (90) days following the close of each calendar
year, Landlord shall submit to Tenant a statement ("Annual Statement"), in which Landlord shall set
forth in reasonable detail the actual expenditures for Common Area Charges for such calendar year
and Tenant's Pro Rata Share of Common Area Charges thereof. The Annual Statement shall be
certified by an authorized agent of Landlord to be correct. Within twenty (20) days of Tenant's
request, Landlord shall provide Tenant with copies of all invoices and other written evidence of
Common Area Charges ("CAM Evidence") paid by Landlord. In the event Landlord fails to
provide such Annual Statement or CAM Evidence within the time periods required hereby, and
thereafter fails to provide such Annual Statement or CAM Evidence within thirty (30) days
following receipt of written notice from Tenant, then Tenant may thereupon defer any payments
relating to Common Area Charges until thirty (30) days following its receipt of the last to occur of
(a) the Annual Statement, or (b) the CAM Evidence.
7.4.6. Reconciliation of Annual Statement. If the Annual Statement indicates that
Tenant's payments of estimated Common Area Charges exceeded Tenant's total obligation relating
to such calendar year, Landlord shall accompany said Annual Statement with a memo crediting
Tenant's account in the amount of such ove1payment or, if the amount of the credit exceeds one (1)
full month's estimated payment for Common Area Charges, Landlord shall accompany said Annual
Statement with a payment to Tenant of all of the amount of such excess. If the Annual Statement
shows that Tenant's payments of estimated Conunon Area Charges were less than its total
obligation relating to such calendar year, Tenant shall pay the difference to Landlord within thirty
(30) days of Tenant's receipt of the Annual Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at the time
Landlord delivers such Annual Statement to Tenant, Tenant is auditing Landlord's records of
Common Area Charges, any adjustment (if required) and any credit or payment shall be made upon
conclusion of such audit.
7.4.7. Audit. Tenant shall have the right, not more frequently than once in any
calendar year, to audit (the "CAM Audit") all of Landlord's or Landlord's agent's records pertaining
to Common Area Charges with a representative of Tenant's choice. Landlord shall retain its records
regarding Common Area Charges for a period of at least two (2) years following the final billing for
each calendar year during the Term at Landlord's corporate office. At any time during such two (2)
year period, upon thirty (30) days' advance notice to Landlord, Tenant may conduct a CAM Audit.
The CAM Audit shall commence on a date (the "Audit Date") of which Tenant has notified
Landlord not less than thirty (30) days in advance. In the event of three (3) cancellations of the
CAM Audit by Landlord, Tenant shall be relieved of its obligation to make monthly payments of the
estimated Common Area Charges or until the CAM Audit is performed and completed. If such
CAM Audit discloses an overbilling of Common Area Charges, Tenant shall promptly deliver a copy

1 of the audit report to Landlord for its review. Within thirty (30) days thereafter, Landlord may, by
2 written notice to Tenant, object to the conclusions or process of the audit report and Landlord shall
3 state its conclusions as to the amount of the overbilling, if any, or that Landlord contends that there
4 is no overbilling. If Tenant disputes Landlord's conclusions, then within ten (10) days of receipt of
5 Landlord's objection to the audit repor t, either party may institute the appropriate Alternative
6 Dispute Resolution proceeding under Section 20.2 of this Lease. If Landlord agrees with the audit
7 report, then it shall promptly thereafter pay to Tenant the amount of overbilling with interest
8 thereupon at the Legal Rate. In the event the overstatement of charges exceeds three percent (3%)
9 of the sum previously billed to Tenant by Landlord, Landlord shall reimburse Tenant for the
10 expenses of the CAM Audit within thirty (30) days following receipt of a copy of the CAM Audit.
11 Tenant covenants to keep such CAM Audit information confidential, except if disclosure is
12 compelled by legal procedure or if required pursuant to any litigation or Alternative Dispute
13 Resolution proceeding between Tenant and Landlord related to the facts disclosed by such CAM
14 Audit.
15 7.4.8. Intentionally Omitted.
16 8. REAL ESTATE TAXES AND ASSESSMENTS
17 8.1. Obligation to Pay.
18 Landlord shall pay all real property taxes and assessments ("Tax" or "Taxes") levied by a
19 government agency against Landlord's Parcel or smaller Tax parcel which includes the Store (the
20 "Tax Bill") on or before the last day that such Taxes may be paid without penalty, commission,
21 interest or other charge. A "Tax parcel" is a single parcel of land for which the relevant taxing
22 authority renders a separate billing. If new real property taxes ("New Taxes") are enacted which are
23 expressly declared by the taxing authority, taxing legislation or legislative history to have been
24 imposed as a result of an alteration in the present tax system and in substitution thereof, then such
25 New Taxes based upon such declaration shall be referred to as enacted on a "substitution basis" and
26 in such event such New Taxes shall be considered a part of the Taxes payable by Tenant pursuant to
27 this Section 8.1. The real estate taxes under the present tax system (to the extent they continue to
28 exist after the alteration in the present tax system) plus the New Taxes enacted on a substitution
29 basis shall collectively be included in the term "Taxes." Furthermore, if any governmental taxing
30 authority levies, assesses or imposes any tax, excise or assessment (other than income or franchise
31 tax) upon or against the Rent payable by Tenant to Landlord ("Rent Tax") either by way of
32 substitution for or in addition to any existing tax on land, buildings or otherwise, Tenant shall
33 directly pay, or reimburse Landlord, for the Rent Tax, as the case may be.
34 8.2. Tenant's Pro Rata Share.
35 8.2.1. Payment of Tenant's Pro Rata Share. In addition to the Minimum Rent herein
36 reserved, Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for Tenant's Pro Rata Share of the Tax Bill, as calculated
37 in accordance with Section 8.2.3, applicable to each Tax Year or part thereof which falls within the
38 Term, subject to the provisions of this Section 8.2.1. Tenant's payment shall be made within thirty
39 (30) days after receipt by Tenant of (a) a copy of Landlord's Tax Bill, and (b) a statement in writing
40 from Landlord setting forth the amount of Tenant's Pro Rata Share of the Tax Bill and the method
41 of calculation thereof. Tenant's schedule of payments shall be concurrent with Landlord's
42 obligations for payment to the taxing authority, but no sooner than twenty (20) days prior to the last

1 date for payment of Taxes that will avoid penalties and/ or interest charges ("Delinquency Date").
2 Within thirty (30) days after the Delinquency Date, Landlord shall provide Tenant with written
3 evidence satisfactory to Tenant of Landlord's payment of Taxes, and in the event Landlord fails to
4 provide Tenant with such evidence within such thirty (30) day period, and thereafter fails to provide
5 such evidence within thirty (30) days following receipt of a second written notice from Tenant, then
6 Tenant may deduct from Rent coming due under this Lease an amount equal to the sum of
7 delinquent Taxes, and at Tenant's option, pay such amount of delinquent Taxes to the applicable
8 taxing authority. Should Tenant elect to make the payment of delinquent Taxes, and thereafter
9 Landlord makes such payment to the taxing authority as well, Tenant shall nonetheless be deemed
10 to have fulfilled its payment obligation and the responsibility for obtaining a refund from the taxing
11 authority shall be that of Landlord.
12 8.2.2. Installments. In the event of assessments which may be paid in installments by
13 reason of bonding or otherwise, Landlord shall elect to make payment based upon the longest
14 period of installment payments permitted by the appropriate taxing authority. Tenant shall bear no
15 liability as to installments due following the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease except for
16 prorated amounts due prior to the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease. Tenant shall not
17 be responsible for any interest, late charge or other penalty resulting from Landlord's late payment
18 or non-payment of Taxes (unless caused by Tenant), nor any administrative or other charge which
19 may be claimed by Landlord.
20 8.2.3. Calculation of Tenant's Pro Rata Share. Tenant's Pro Rata Share of the Tax Bill
21 is defined as that fraction of Taxes the numerator of which is the Leasable Floor Area in the Store
22 and the denominator of which is the Leasable Floor Area in the Tax parcel (as shown on the Site
23 Plan attached as Exhibit B); provided, however, in no event shall the denominator of said fraction
24 be less than the Minimum Leasable Floor Area as set forth in Section 1.3.2(b). Further, in no event
25 shall the denominator include the Leasable Floor Area of any tenant or occupant of Landlord's
26 Parcel which is separately assessed or separately billed for Taxes nor shall Taxes payable by Tenant
27 hereunder include Ta..'{es which are separately assessed to such tenant or occupant. Such
28 computation shall be made separately for each Tax Year and shall be set forth in reasonable detail as
29 a part of Landlord's statement to Tenant pursuant to Section 7.4.5. The Tax parcel on which the
30 Store is located shall not contain more Common Areas than is consistent with the overall Common
31 Area square footage to building area ratio of Landlord's Parcel.
32 8.2.4. Partial Year. Should Tenant be in occupancy during only a portion of the first or
33 final Tax Year, Tenant shall be responsible to pay Landlord only for a pro rata portion of its Tax
34 obligation as described herein, based on the portion of such Tax Year included in the Term of this
35 Lease.
36 8.2.5. Tenant Audit. Tenant shall have the right, after not less than thirty (30) days'
37 notice, to audit Landlord's or Landlord's agent's records pertaining to Taxes with a representative of
38 Tenant's choice. Landlord shall retain its records regarding Taxes for a period of at least two (2)
39 years following the final billing for the calendar year in question. At any time during such two (2)
40 year period, Tenant may conduct its audit. If such Tax audit discloses an overbilling of Taxes,
41 Tenant shall promptly deliver a copy of the audit report to Landlord for its review. Within thirty
42 (30) days thereafter, Landlord may, by written notice to Tenant, object to the conclusions or process
43 of the audit report and Landlord shall state its conclusions as to the amount of the overbilling, if
44 any, or that Landlord contends that there is no overbilling. If Tenant disputes Landlord's
45 conclusions, then within ten (10) days of receipt of Landlord's objection to the audit report, either

1 party may institute the appropriate Alternative Dispute Resolution proceeding under Section 20.2 of
2 this Lease. If Landlord agrees with the audit report, then it shall promptly thereafter pay to Tenant
3 the amount of overbilling with interest tl1ereupon at the Legal Rate. In the event the overstatement
4 of charges exceeds three percent (3%) of the sum previously billed to Tenant by Landlord, Landlord
5 shall reimburse Tenant for the reasonable expenses of such audit. Tenant covenants to keep the
6 audit information confidential, except if disclosure is compelled by legal procedure or if required
7 pursuant to any litigation or Alternative Dispute Resolution proceeding between Tenant and
8 Landlord related to the facts disclosed by such Tax audit.
9 8.3. Exclusions.
10 There shall be excluded from the Taxes to which Tenant contributes: (a) any increase in
11 Taxes caused by construction in Landlord's Parcel commenced subsequent to the date of this Lease
12 until such time as such newly constructed space constitutes Leasable Floor Area; (b) any increase in
13 Taxes caused directly by a Change of Ownership Assessment as defined herein; (c) income, excess
14 profits, gross profits, estate, single business, inheritance, succession, transfer, franchise, capital or
15 other tax or assessment upon Landlord or the Rent payable under this Lease (other than Rent Tax as
16 defined in Section 8.1); (d) bonds and/or assessments which have been or, subsequent to the date
17 hereof are, levied for tl1e pw.pose of funding the costs of construction for Landlord's development
18 or redevelopment of, all or any portion of Landlord's Parcel or capital improvements constructed
19 therein or with respect thereto, or any Off-Site Improvements; (e) any taxes or assessments levied
20 related to the usage (as contrasted with the construction or installation) of any utilities to the Store
21 or Landlord's Parcel, such as water or sewer charges included in the Tax Bill; (Â£) any special
22 (non-general) assessments (such as assessments related to only Landlord's Parcel or the Shopping
23 Center); (g) tax increment financing fees, taxes or assessments for improvements related to
24 Landlord's Parcel or the Shopping Center; and (h) any Taxes assessed against land in Landlord's
25 Parcel that has not been fully developed as buildings or Common Areas. A "Change of Ownership
26 Assessment" is any increase in the tax assessment of Landlord's Parcel or Tax parcel (as herein
27 defined) resulting solely and directly from a change in the ownership or title holding of any property
28 within the Tax parcel under the provisions of any real property tax statute for the state in which the
29 property is located, such as, by way of example, California Revenue and Taxation Code section 60
30 et. seq.
31 8.4. Rebates.
32 Any rebates, refunds, or abatements of real estate Taxes received by Landlord subsequent to
33 the reimbursement of Taxes by Tenant, including, but not limited to, tax increment financing
34 rebates or subsidies received by Landlord from the applicable taxing authority, shall, provided
35 Tenant has previously made a contributory payment in respect thereof, be refunded to Tenant on a
36 pro rata basis within ten (10) days of receipt by Landlord. Any such rebate, refund or abatement
37 realized by Landlord prior to payment by Tenant shall result in an appropriate reduction in Tenant's
38 Pro Rata Share of Taxes then due to Landlord.
39 8.5. Contest.
40 If Landlord does not elect to contest Taxes and Tenant and at least one other tenant
41 occupying at least thirty thousand (30,000) square feet of Leasable Floor Area in Landlord's Parcel,
42 desire that Taxes be contested, Tenant shall have such rights to contest the validity or amount of
43 Taxes in the Tax Bill as are permitted by law, either in its own name or in the name of Landlord, in

1 either case with Landlord's full cooperation. In conjunction with any such contest, Landlord shall
2 make available to Tenant, upon request, such information as Tenant may reasonably request related
3 to Taxes, which information may be required by the Assessor in connection with a tax contest.
4 Landlord shall provide Tenant with government notices of assessment (or reassessment) in time
5 sufficient to reasonably permit Tenant, at Tenant's election, to make contest. If Tenant declines to
6 contest Taxes, and if Landlord chooses to do so, Landlord shall notify Tenant immediately upon
7 Landlord's filing of any contest and the reasonable cost of such contest shall be a part of the Tax
8 Bill. The term "contest" as used in this Section 8.5 means contest, appeal, abatement or other
9 proceeding prescribed by applicable law to obtain a tax reduction or tax refund, howsoever
10 denominated. The net benefit of any contest, after the payment of expenses thereof, shall inure to
11 the benefit of Tenant and all other occupants of the parcel(s) included in the Tax Bill in the same
12 proportions as their respective obligations for Taxes to which the contest relates.

14 9. INSURANCE
15 9.1. Casualty Insurance.
16 9.1.1. Special Form Policy. A policy of fire and casualty insurance at least as broad as
17 the form of the Insurance Services Offices' ISO Property form 1030 - Causes of Loss Special Form
18 or equivalent ("Special Form Policy"). The term "Casualty Insurance" means insurance covering
19 damage to tangible real and personal property.
20 9.1.2. Landlord Insurance. Commencing on the Delivery Date, as defined in Article 2
21 hereof, and at all times during the Term, Landlord shall maintain a Special Form Policy insuring
22 against damage to Landlord's Parcel, including Tenant's permanent leasehold improvements and
23 alterations in the Store constructed by Landlord or Tenant, but excluding Tenants' non-permanent
24 trade fixtures, trade equipment, inventory and other personal property situated thereon. Further,
25 upon completion of construction of Landlord's Parcel (exclusive of pads, Outparcels and any phase
26 of development to be completedÂ· at a later date) such insurance shall be obtained with an owner's
27 rating for Landlord's Parcel based upon a completed project as opposed to a property under
28 development. All Special Form Policy(ies) shall be in the amount of at least ninety percent (90%) of
29 the replacement cost, including demolition cost exclusive of any foundation or excavation costs, and
30 Landlord agrees that it shall be responsible at its sole cost and expense for any shortfall in insurance
31 proceeds due to Landlord not maintaining Special Form Policy on the amount of the full guaranteed
32 replacement cost. Landlord shall on or before the Delivery Date, and thereafter upon request of
33 Tenant, provide Tenant with a certificate of such insurance coverage &om an insurer licensed to do
34 business within the state in which the Store is located, and which insurer is rated at least A- and VII
35 in Best's Insurance Reports, or equivalent.
36 9.1.3. Tenant Insurance. In lieu of Landlord performing the obligation specified in

1 9.1.4. Tenant's Share.
2 (a) If Tenant does not exercise its rights under Section 9.1.3 during the Term,
3 Tenant shall be responsible to reimburse Landlord for Tenant's Pro Rata Share of the premium for the
4 insurance described in Section 9.1.1 above, excluding (i) any management or administrative fees and
5 (ii) earthquake, flood or terrorism insurance, within thirty (30) days after receipt by Tenant of written
6 evidence of Landlord's payment of the insurance premium, together with a statement, certified by an
7 agent of Landlord to be true, indicating the total cost of the premium applicable to Landlord's Parcel,
8 accompanied by a copy of the premium billing and the declaration page from Landlord's policy, and
9 setting forth such further information as Tenant may reasonably require to substantiate the amount of
10 such premium and the manner in which the premium and Tenant's Pro Rata Share thereof have been
11 calculated. If Landlord covers the Store with a Special Form Policy which includes premises other
12 than Landlord's Parcel, Landlord shall provide a breakdown indicating the premium portion thereof
13 attributable to Landlord's Parcel. Tenant's Pro Rata Share for purposes of this Section 9.1.4(a) shall be
14 that fraction of the total premium the numerator of which is the Leasable Floor Area of the Store and
15 the denominator of which is the Leasable Floor Area of the applicable portion thereof for which the
16 premium billing was issued by the insurer, and which includes the Store (the "Insurance Bill"),
17 provided, however, in no event shall the denominator of said fraction be less than the Minimum
18 Leasable Floor Area as set forth in Section 1.3.2( c). In no event shall Tenant's payment to Landlord of
19 Tenant's Pro Rata Share of the premium for the Special Form Policy exceed that amount which
20 Tenant would have paid for the same or similar coverage for the Store had it obtained such coverage
21 from its own carrier. Tenant shall not be responsible for any interest, late charge or other penalty
22 resulting from Landlord's late payment or nonpayment of the insurance premium.
23 (b) In the event Landlord fails to provide such written evidence of payment
24 within thirty (30) days after payment and thereafter fails to provide such written evidence within ten
25 (10) days after Tenant's written request therefor, Tenant may obtain the same or similar coverage and
26 deduct from Rent coming due under this Lease an amount equal to the amount of Tenant's Pro Rata
27 Share of the Insurance Bill, which sum shall be repaid to Landlord (less the cost of any insurance
28 Tenant carried before Landlord provided the evidence of coverage) upon Landlord's delivery to
29 Tenant of the evidence herein required of Landlord's payment of such insurance premiums. In the
30 event Tenant receives a notice of cancellation of the Special Form Policy or other evidence indicating
31 that Landlord has failed to maintain the Special Form Policy on the Store, Tenant shall not be
32 responsible for reimbursement under Section 9.1.4(a). In the event Landlord fails to maintain the
33 Special Form Policy on the Store and it is not possible for Tenant to separately insure the Store, Tenant
34 may obtain the Special Form Policy for the entire Landlord's Parcel and deduct all premium amounts
35 related thereto from Rent coming due.
36 (c) Landlord or Landlord's agent shall retain full and detailed records of all
37 costs incurred by Landlord for the Special Form Policy. Copies of any of said records shall be made
38 available to Tenant upon request and Tenant shall have the right to audit all of such records, including
39 the policy, after thirty (30) days' notice, with a representative of Tenant's choice. Any overbilling
40 discovered in the course of such audit shall be refunded to Tenant together with interest at the Legal
41 Rate specified in Article 2 within thirty (30) days of Landlord's receipt of a copy of the audit. In the
42 event the overstatement of charges exceeds three percent (3%) of the sum previously billed to Tenant
43 by Landlord, Landlord shall reimburse Tenant for all expenses of such audit. Landlord shall retain its
44 records regarding insurance premiums for a period of at least two (2) years following the final billing
45 for the calendar year in question. At any time during such two (2) year period, Tenant may conduct its

3 existence in force of the policies of insurance described in Sections 9 .2.1 and 9 .2.2, together with
4 endorsements showing that the parties have been named as additional insureds. Each of the

7 designated on such certificate as the holder thereof. Landlord shall use commercially reasonable
8 efforts to provide a breakdown of the premium cost related to the Common Area only and the

10 9.4. Waiver of Subrogation.
11 On and after the Delivery Date and throughout the Term, Landlord and Tenant hereby
12 waive and release any and all right to maintain a direct action to recover against the other, including
13 the employees, officers, directors and agents of Landlord and Tenant, for damages and any and all
14 loss (including loss of Rent) to any property located within the Store or Landlord's Parcel, which
15 damage or loss occurs during a period which is covered or could be covered by a Special Form
16 Policy required under this Lease, and which arises out of the other party's negligence or otherwise
17 tortious acts or omissions, but only to the extent that the cost of repairing such damage or loss is
18 covered by insurance required under this Lease, or would have been covered by insurance proceeds
19 payable under any policy required to be maintained under this Lease, but not so maintained. Each
20 policy of such insurance shall either, (a) contain a waiver of subrogation by the insurer against
21 Tenant and Landlord, as the case may be, or (b) include the name of Landlord or Tenant, as the case
22 may be, as an additional insured, but not as a party to whom any loss shall be made payable. In the
23 event a party is unable to obtain such a waiver, it shall immediately notify the other of this inability.
24 In the absence of such notification, each party shall be deemed to have obtained such waiver of
25 subrogation. Further, Tenant's agreement to indemnify Landlord, and Landlord's agreement to
26 indemnify Tenant under this Lease, are not intended and shall not relieve any insurance carrier of its
27 obligations under policies required to be carried by Tenant or Landlord pursuant to the provisions
28 of this Lease, to the extent such policies cover, or if carried would have covered the matters subject
29 to the parties' respective indemnification obligations; nor shall they supersede any inconsistent
30 agreement of the parties set forth in any other provision of this Lease. This mutual waiver is in
31 addition to any other waiver or release contained in this Lease. The provisions of this Section 9.4

33 merchandise damaged by roof leaks as specified in Section 11.2.1.

37 have the option, either alone or in conjunction with any parent, subsidiaries or affiliates of Signatory
38 Tenant, to maintain self-insurance and/ or provide or maintain any insurance required by Signatory
39 Tenant under this Lease under blanket and/or broad form insurance policies maintained by
40 Signatory Tenant or by any such parent, subsidiaries or affiliates of Signatory Tenant, provided the
41 same does not thereby decrease the insurance coverage or limits set forth in this Lease. Any
42 self-insurance shall be deemed to contain all of the terms and conditions applicable to such
43 insurance as required in this Lease, including, without limitation, a full waiver of subrogation. If
44 Signatory Tenant elects to so self-insure, then with respect to any claims which may result from

16 without profit. At all times during the Tenn, Tenant shall have the right to contract with any third
17 party of Tenant's choice to provide some or all of the utility services for the Store and any additional
18 expense for additional utility lines or other requirements of the third party utility service provider
19 shall be at Tenant's sole cost and expense. Landlord shall, at Landlord's sole cost and expense, pay

22 prepared by or compiled by the utility agency which provides water service so as to calculate
23 Tenant's share of the sewer service charges without consideration of the use of water by any other
24 tenant in the Shopping Center. Landlord shall separate out all utilities and install separate meters for
25 the Store. The utilities shall be registered by Tenant in Tenant's name. Tenant shall be entitled to

1 Tenant. Tenant's withholding of, or failure to pay Rent pursuant to a bona fide dispute between
2 Landlord and Tenant shall not be deemed a default by Tenant under the provisions of this Lease.
3 (b) Insolvency. If Tenant makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors,

7 (c) Landlord's Remedies. If Tenant is in default under this Lease, Landlord

19 by Landlord to effect such reletting to the extent proportionately allocable to the remaining Term of
20 this Lease.
21 (d) Prohibition Against Landlord Accelerating Rent.
22 (i) Except as provided in Section 20.1. l (d)(ii) below, and whether or
23 not Landlord terminates this Lease, Tenant shall have no obligation to pay Rent until the date it would
24 otherwise be due in the absence of Tenant's default. Landlord shall have no right to accelerate Rent
25 which would become due except as provided hereafter.
26 (ii) In the event Landlord terminates this Lease due to a default by
27 Tenant, Landlord may recover from Tenant the balance of the Rent payable by Tenant for the
28 remainder of the Tenn, minus the fair market rental value of the Store for such period, each
29 discounted to present value using a discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco at the
30 time of the award, plus one percent (1 %) per annum.
31 (e) Personal Property Waiver. Landlord waives such liens, if any, to which it
32 may have a right with respect to the merchandise, furniture, trade fixtures and other personal property
33 of Tenant located on or about the Store, and Landlord shall from time to time execute such documents
34 as Tenant may reasonably request to acknowledge such waiver.
35 (f) Landlord's Remedy for Improper Offset. Certain provisions of this Lease
36 grant to Tenant the right to offset specified amounts against, or to deduct such amounts from, Rent or
37 other charges payable under this Lease. The exercise by Tenant of any such right or Tenant's

10 days), the occurrence of either of the following shall constitute a default by Landlord pursuant to this
11 Lease: (i) Landlord's failure to perform any of its obligations under this Lease, which default continues
12 for a period of more than thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice from Tenant specifying such
13 default; or (ii) Landlord's failure to perform any maintenance, repair or replacement obligation within
14 the time periods set forth in Section 11.2.1 after notice as required in Section 11.2.1, however, such
15 respective time periods set forth in Section 11.2.1 may be extended (not to exceed ninety (90) days

17 within thirty (30) days after such notice; (B) Landlord commences efforts to cure the default within
18 thirty (30) days after receipt of Tenant's notice of default; and (C) Landlord diligently pursues
19 completion of the obligation.
20 (b) Remedies.
21 (i) General. In the event of Landlord's default, in addition to availing
22 itself of any other remedies available at law and in equity, Tenant may, at its option, upon written
23 notice to Landlord, terminate this Lease, or may incur any expense necessary to perform the obligation
24 of Landlord specified in such notice and deduct such expense from the Rent or other charges coming
25 due. In the event Tenant deducts any expenses incurred pursuant to this Section 20.1.2(bW), such
26 deduction in any one (1) month shall be limited to fifty percent (50%) of each successive installment of
27 Rent payable by Tenant hereunder ("Reimbursement Cap"), until Tenant is reimbursed in full unless
28 such Reimbursement Cap is insufficient to reimburse Tenant in full during the remainder of the Term,
29 in which event the Reimbursement Cap will be increased such that Tenant is reimbursed the entire
30 amount of its costs by the end of the Tenn. The Reimbursement Cap described in this paragraph shall
31 not apply to any liquidated damages that may become payable under Section 5.4 of this Lease.
32 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, Tenant shall have the unrestricted right to
33 deduct from Rent next coming due if (A) authorized by a court of competent jurisdiction, or (B) by
34 Arbitration, or (C) Tenant obtains a judgment in any legal proceeding. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
35 prior to exercising its right to terminate this Lease, Tenant shall give Landlord a second notice of
36 Landlord's default and an additional thirty (30) days to cure said default.
37 (ii) Interruption of Service. In addition to the remedies described
38 above, in the event Tenant is prevented from using the Store, or any portion thereof (the "Unusable
39 Area"), to conduct its normal retail operations (A) for a period exceeding three (3) consecutive
40 business days as a result of the interruption of any utility service to the Unusable Area directly caused
41 by the willful act or negligence of Landlord, its contractors, agents or employees, or (B) for a period
42 exceeding thirty (30) consecutive days as a result of the interruption of any utility service which is not
43 caused by the willful act or negligence of Landlord to the Unusable Area which is required to be

4 exceeding three (3) consecutive business days as a result of Force Majeure, then the provisions of this
5 Section 20.1.2.(b)(ii) shall apply. Tenant shall promptly deliver to Landlord notice of the interruption
6 (the "Interruption Notice") of such condition and if Landlord fails to cure such condition within two
7 (2) business days after delivery to it of the Interruption Notice, then Rent applicable to the Unusable
8 Area shall be abated from the date which occurs either (a) three (3) full business days following the
9 three (3) day interruption period, or (b) thirty (30) full business days following the thirty (30) day
10 interruption period (whichever period is applicable as set forth in clauses (A) through (D) above), until
11 the date when such failure is cured. If any condition set forth in the first sentence of this Section shall
12 not be cured within sixty (60) days after Landlord's receipt of the Interruption Notice, then Tenant,
13 upon notice to Landlord after expiration of such period, may terminate this Lease either as to (a) the
14 Unusable Area, in which case this Lease shall be amended to reflect that the Unusable Area is no
15 longer a part of the Store, and the Rent payable hereunder by Tenant shall be adjusted proportionately,
16 or (b) the entire Store, which termination shall be deemed effective upon Tenant's vacation of the
17 entire Store.

5 whether insured or uninsured, which causes damage or destruction to the Store or Landlord's Parcel.
6 21.1.2. Casualty Date. The date of the occurrence of a Casualty.
7 21.1.3. Permitted Repair Period. A period of two hundred forty (240) days following

10 or repairs due to a Casualty under Section 21.2 of this Lease or due to a Taking under Section 22.1
11 of this Lease.
12 21.2. Insured Casualty.
13 If the Store is damaged or destroyed by a Casualty insured against or that Landlord is
14 obligated to insure against under this Lease, to the extent that Restoration cannot reasonably be
15 completed within the Permitted Repair Period, as reasonably determined by Landlord (and Landlord
16 shall deliver notice to Tenant of such determination within thirty (30) days of the Casualty Date),
17 Tenant may, at its option, terminate this Lease as of the Casualty Date by notice to Landlord within
18 forty-five (45) days after the Casualty Date. If Tenant does not so terminate this Lease, or if
19 Restoration to the Store may be completed within the Permitted Repair Period, then this Lease shall
20 not terminate, and Landlord shall diligently proceed to Restore the Store to substantially the
21 condition as existed immediately prior to the Casualty, and Landlord shall diligently pursue such
22 Restoration to completion. If the Restoration is not completed within the Permitted Repair Period,
23 Tenant may terminate this Lease by written notice to Landlord at any time prior to the Redelivery
24 Date. All Rent payable hereunder shall abate from the Casualty Date to the earlier of (a) sixty (60)
25 days following the Redelivery Date; or (b) the date on which Tenant again opens for business in the
26 Store (in either case the "Recommencement Date"); provided that if Tenant continues to do
27 business in the Store during the period of Restoration, Tenant's obligation to pay Rent shall be
28 abated equitably based upon the Leasable Floor Area of the Store that Tenant is unable to utilize
29 during the Restoration. The election by Tenant to carry the insurance on the Store pursuant to the
30 terms of Section 9.5 shall not create any obligation on the part of Tenant to Restore, but Tenant
31 shall make available to Landlord the proceeds from such insurance for Landlord's use in discharging
32 Landlord's Restoration obligations under this Section 21.2. In no event shall Tenant be deemed to

12 to pay Rent shall be abated equitably based upon the Leasable Floor Area of the Store that Tenant is
13 unable to utilize during the Restoration.
14 21.4. End of Term Casualty.
15 Notwithstanding any provision in this Article 21 to the contrary, Landlord shall not be
16 required to Restore any Casualty to the Store occurring during the final eighteen (18) months of the
17 Term if the cost of such Restoration is greater than One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars
18 ($150,000) unless, within thirty (30) days after receipt of Landlord's notice to Tenant that it intends
19 not to effect Restoration, Tenant exercises in writing an Option to extend the Term given Tenant

23 21.5. Landlord's Parcel Casualty.
24 In the event that the Store is not damaged or destroyed by a Casualty, but other buildings in
25 Landlord's Parcel, or the Building, excluding the Store, or if any of the Common Areas, are damaged
26 or destroyed by a Casualty, whether or not insured against (collectively, a "Landlord's Parcel

28 destruction, and Landlord shall promptly Restore such damaged buildings in Landlord's Parcel as

32 Common Areas are usable. Except as otherwise expressly stated in this Section 21.5, the provisions
33 of Sections 21.1 through 21.4 shall apply to a Landlord's Parcel Casualty, except to the extent of a
34 conflict with the OEA. If the damage to the Common Areas shall render the whole or any part of
35 the Store unsuitable for Tenant's use, all Rent payable hereunder shall abate from the Casualty Date
36 to the Recommencement Date; provided that if Tenant continues to do business in the Store during
37 the period of Restoration, Tenant's total obligation for Rent shall equitably abated.

13 Restoration of the Store thereafter with reasonable dispatch, Tenant, upon ten (10) days' prior notice
14 to Landlord, shall have the right to Restore the Store at Landlord's sole cost and expense. If Tenant
15 elects to Restore, Landlord shall promptly pay to Tenant any insurance proceeds relating to the
16 Casualty. In addition, all Rent shall abate as described in Section 21.2 above; provided that if Tenant
17 continues to do business in the Store during the period of Repair, Tenant's total obligation to pay
18 Rent shall be abated equitably based upon the Leasable Floor Area of the Store that Tenant is
19 unable to utilize during the Restoration. Further, Landlord shall reimburse Tenant upon demand for
20 any cost or expense incurred by Tenant for such Restoration (not including any amount by which
21 the cost and expense of Restoration is increased by any change or changes made by Tenant) in
22 excess of the insurance proceeds received by Tenant plus interest at the Legal Rate. Such payment
23 shall be made by Landlord within thirty (30) days from receipt of (a) an invoice setting forth such
24 cost(s) with reasonable proof that such cost(s) were paid by Tenant; and (b) copies of lien waivers
25 for the amount claimed by Tenant. Until Tenant has been fully reimbursed for such costs and
26 expenses, Tenant may deduct the same from any payments of Rent or other charges due hereunder
27 to Landlord. If at the expiration of the Term, Tenant has not been fully reimbursed, Tenant shall
28 have the right to extend the Term for any period of time (but not in excess of twenty-one (21) years)
29 selected by Tenant which is less than or equal to the period which shall enable Tenant to recover
30 such cost and expense plus interest at the Legal Rate from Rent due hereunder. During such
31 extension, Rent shall be imputed as being that in effect in the month immediately preceding such

10 improvements, alterations, fixtures, equipment and furniture as Tenant deems necessaiy for
11 resuming business in the Store. In the event Rent shall completely abate for any period pursuant to
12 the provisions of this Article 21, the Term shall toll for the period of such abatement, in which
13 event, the monthly installments of Rent following the end of the period of such abatement shall
14 recommence and thereafter continue at the same Rent rate that was in effect at the time of such
15 abatement; the remaining scheduled increases of Minimum Rent shall be postponed for the period
16 of such abatement to reflect such tolling, the expiration date of the then applicable Term (whether
17 the Initial Tenn or any Option Period) and the commencement and expiration dates of any
18 subsequent Option Periods shall be extended for the period of such abatement, as shall be the
19 deadline dates for notices exercising Option Periods. Any period of tolling shall be added to the
20 calculation of the Initial Term (or any then current Option Period, as the case may be) for purposes
21 of the calculation of the Expiration Date. For example, if the Term of this Lease is tolled under the
22 provisions of this Section 21.10 for a period of four (4) months, and the tolling occurs during the
23 Initial Term, then the definition of Initial Term in Section 1.5.1 shall be: "From the
24 Commencement Date through the January 31 next following the expiration of one hundred
25 twenty-four (124) months thereafter."
26 21.11. Effect of Termination.
27 Upon termination of this Lease pursuant to this Article 21, each of the parties shall be
28 thereby released from all further obligations and duties to the other party as of the Casualty Date,
29 except for items and liabilities which have theretofore accrued and be then unpaid, and Landlord
30 shall promptly refund to Tenant all unearned Rent and other amounts prepaid by Tenant under this
31 Lease.
32 21.12. Tenant's Right of First Offer.
33 The provisions of this Article 21 to the contrary notwithstanding, if this Lease is terminated
34 in accordance with this Article 21, and Landlord elects to rebuild the Store or a substantially similar
35 building in Landlord's Parcel within three (3) years after the Casualty Date, Landlord shall first offer
36 such space in such building to Tenant before marketing such space in any other manner on terms no
37 less favorable than those for which Landlord will market such space.

2 22.1. Taking.
3 A "Taking" means any governmental act, condemnation proceeding, moratorium, initiative,
4 or referendum whereby Landlord or Tenant is divested of ownership or any of the incidents thereof,
5 or any transfer in lieu thereof. In the event Tenant does not terminate this Lease as provided in
6 Section 22.2 following, Landlord shall promptly and diligently Restore the Store, Conunon Areas, or
7 other space, as the case may be, to as near their condition as existed prior to such Taking as is
8 reasonably possible. During the course of such Restoration, if Tenant is not operating in the Store,
9 all Rent shall abate from the date of the Taking to the Recommencement Date. If Tenant continues
10 to do business in the Store during the period of Restoration, Tenant's obligation to pay Rent shall be
11 abated equitably based upon tl1e Leasable Floor Area of the Store tl1at Tenant is unable to utilize
12 during the Restoration. When Restoration is complete, Tenant's total obligation for Minimwn Rent
13 and Reimbursements shall be adjusted as provided in Section 3. 7 in the event the size of the Store is
14 reduced. When Restoration is complete, if the size of the Store is not reduced, but the size of the
15 Common Areas is reduced, Minimum Rent shall thereafter be reduced to an amount calculated by
16 multiplying the Minimum Rent stated in this Lease by a fraction the numerator of which is tl1e fair
17 market rental value of the Store immediately following the Taking and the denominator of which is
18 the fair market rental value of the Store in1mediately prior to the Taking.
19 22.2. Right to Terminate.
20 Tenant may terminate this Lease upon written notice to Landlord in the event of any one or
21 more of the following Takings:
22 22.2.1. A Taking of any portion of or interest in the Store;
23 22.2.2. Any Taking of the Common Areas if the number of parking spaces is reduced
24 below applicable governmental ordinance, or access to the Store is materially impaired, or access to
25 Landlord's Parcel is materially impaired;
26 22.2.3. Any Taking of any portion of Landlord's Parcel which materially impairs the
27 operation of Tenant's business; or
28 22.2.4. Any Taking of twenty percent (20%) or more of the Leasable Floor Area of
29 Landlord's Parcel (excluding the Store in either the numerator or denominator of such calculation).
30 22.2.5. Tenant's termination must be exercised within sixty (60) days following tl1e date
31 of such Taking by written notice to Landlord.
32 22.3. Claims.
33 In the event of any Taking, whether or not this Lease has been terminated as a result
34 thereof, Tenant shall have the right to make any separate claims allowed by the laws of the
35 Commonwealth of Virginia against the condemning authority for the following: (a) the
36 Unamortized Cost of its fixtures, equipment and other personal property; (b) its relocation expenses;
37 (c) the Unamortized Cost of any leasehold improvements constructed and paid for by Tenant in and
38 to the Store (not reimbursed by Landlord); and (d) such other award as may be allowed under

2 award is given and Tenant is not permitted to pursue its separate claim, then Tenant shall have the
3 right to share in such award relative to the aforesaid claims to the extent included in such award.
4 22.4. Waiver.
5 The parties waive such rights of Lease termination as may be granted them in the event of
6 condemnation by the laws of the state wherein the Store is located, it being their agreement that the
7 rights of termination set forth in this Lease shall be exclusive.
8 23. MECHANIC'S LIENS
9 Landlord and Tenant shall prevent any mechanic's, materialman's or other liens against the
10 Store or the Shopping Center in connection with any labor, materials or services furnished or
11 claimed to have been furnished. If any such lien shall be filed against the Store or the Shopping
12 Center, the party through whom the lien arose will cause the same to be discharged within thirty (30)
13 days of the filing of the lien, provided, however, that either party may contest any such lien, so long
14 as the enforcement thereof is stayed by bonding or otherwise expunging the lien from the official
15 property records in the jurisdiction.
16 24. SIGNS
17 24.1. Governmental Approval and Compliance.
18 All signs shall be subject to the OEA and approved by local governmental authority. Tenant
19 shall obtain, with Landlord's cooperation, approval for Tenant's signs as shown on Exhibit J

30 fabricated, installed and maintained by Tenant at its sole cost and expense.

33 monument sign structure upon which Tenant may install Tenant's Signs in the locations specified on
34 the Site Plan. Tenant's signage on Landlord's sign structure shall be located on the pylon sign

5 powers and remedies of the parties contained in this Lease shall be construed as cumulative and no
6 one of them exclusive of any other or of any legal or equitable remedy which either party might
7 otherwise have in the event of a breach by the other, and the exercise of one right or remedy by a
8 party shall not in any way impair its right to any other right or remedy.
9 26.5. Partial Months.
10 For purposes of computing dates for expirations, Option Periods, Rent adjustments or
11 cancellations (except for those dates specifically designated herein), any partial month at the
12 commencement of the Term shall be disregarded.

14 Unless a different standard is otherwise specifically stated, wherever in this Lease Landlord
15 or Tenant is required to give its consent or approval to any action on the part of the other, such
16 consent or approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

25 wherein the Store is located, except as otherwise required by mandatory provisions of law.
26 26.10. Due Authority.

2 warranties between the parties, and all reliance with respect to representations is solely upon the
3 representations and agreements contained in this Lease. This Lease may only be modified or
4 amended by an agreement in writing signed by the parties hereto.
5 26.12. Entry by Landlord.
6 Upon reasonable prior notice, in no event to be less than five (5) business days (except in the
7 case of a bona fide emergency, in which event, no prior written notice shall be required, but prior
8 verbal notice shall be required promptly confirmed in writing thereafter), Landlord may enter the
9 Store during Tenant's business hours for purposes of inspection, to show the Store to prospective
10 purchasers and lenders, or to perform maintenance and repair obligations imposed upon Landlord
11 by this Lease. All maintenance, repairs or replacements by Landlord to the interior of the Store or
12 using the interior of the Store or maintenance, repairs or replacements to any portion of the
13 Shopping Center that will create dust, noise, vibration or other disturbance of Tenant's use of the
14 Store shall be performed only during hours that the Store is not open to the public. Should
15 Landlord unreasonably interfere with Tenant's business by such entry, Rent shall equitably abate

21 presumption, inference or conclusion shall be drawn against the party that drafted the provision in
22 question.
23 26.14. Force Majeure.
24 As used in this Lease, the term "Force Majeure" means delay resulting from causes beyond a
25 party's reasonable control such as strikes, walkouts or other labor disputes, acts of God, inability to
26 obtain labor, materials or merchandise, adverse weather, governmental restrictions, regulations or
27 controls (hereinafter "governmental matters") excluding from governmental matters planning and
28 building permits, if issued within the average time period for doing so in the issuing jurisdiction for
29 the last twelve (12) months, and governmental approvals and inspections if performed pursuant to
30 the jurisdictions and conditions within the average period of time of requesting the jurisdictions
31 approval or inspection, judicial orders, war, riot or civil commotion, fire or casualty. The party
32 obliged to perform shall give prompt notice to the other as soon as reasonably possible after the
33 onset of such delay stating the cause and an estimate of the duration thereof. If, as a result of an
34 event of Force Majeure, either party shall be delayed or hindered or prevented from the
35 performance of any act required hereunder (other than the making of payments) within the time
36 period set forth herein, the performance of such act shall be excused for the period of delay not to
37 exceed sixty (60) days, and the period of performance of such act shall be extended for a period
38 equivalent to the period of such delay not to exceed sixty (60) days, unless a provision of this Lease
39 expressly states that Force Majeure is not applicable, such as for the calculation of the Permitted
40 Delivery Days and the Automatic Termination Date. Financial inability to perform shall not
41 constitute an event of Force Majeure.

6 This Lease shall not be recorded. However, a Memorandum of Lease shall be executed, in
7 recordable form, by both parties concurrently herewith. Either party may record the same at its own
8 cost and expense.
9 26.17. Real Estate Brokers
10 Landlord and Tenant each represents and warrants to the other party that it has not
11 authorized or employed, or acted by implication to authorize or employ, any real estate broker or
12 salesman to act for it in connection with this Lease, other than Divaris Real Estate ("Brokers"), who
13 shall be paid by Landlord at the rate of Two Dollars ($2) per square foot of Leasable Floor Area in
14 the Store, fifty percent (50%) upon the execution of this Lease by Landlord and Tenant and fifty
15 percent (50%) upon the earlier of (a) Tenant opening the Store for business, or (b) the
16 Commencement Date. Landlord and Tenant shall each indemnify, defend and hold the other party
17 harmless from and against any and all claims by any other real estate broker or salesman whom the
18 indemnifying party authorized or employed, or acted by implication to authorize or employ, to act
19 for the indemnifying party in connection with this Lease. Further, in the event Landlord fails to pay
20 the Brokers within thirty (30) days of the date that such commission is due to be paid, Tenant, at its
21 option, may pay the Brokers' fees and deduct the same from Rent as it comes due.
22 26.18. Exculpation/Sale by Landlord
23 If Landlord shall fail to perform any covenant, term or condition of this Lease upon
24 Landlord's part to be performed and, as a consequence of such default, Tenant shall recover a
25 money judgment against Landlord, so long as Landlord maintains an Equity Interest (as herein
26 defined) in an amount which is not less than twenty percent (20%) of the fair market value of the
27 Shopping Center, such judgment shall be satisfied only out of the proceeds of sale received upon
28 execution of such judgment and levy thereon against the right, title and interest of Landlord in the
29 Shopping Center as the same may then be encumbered and neither Landlord, nor any of the
30 partners comprising Landlord shall be liable for any deficiency. Except for Landlord's fraud,
31 misconduct or misrepresentation, Tenant shall not have the right to levy execution against any
32 property of Landlord other than its interest in the Shopping Center parcel (including the rents,
33 profits and proceeds as the same may be then encumbered) as hereinbefore expressly provided. The
34 term "Equity Interest" as used herein shall mean the remainder derived after subtracting from the
35 fair market value of the Shopping Center (to be determined as provided below) the aggregate
36 amount of all indebtedness secured by recorded liens against the Shopping Center. For purposes of
37 this Section 26.18, the fair market value of the Shopping Center shall be determined by an appraiser
38 who is (a) a member of the American Appraisal Institute or equivalent professional organization,
39 and (b) selected by Tenant. All costs and expenses related to the determination of fair market value
40 of the Shopping Center including, without limitation, any fees charged by the appraiser, shall be
41 borne by Landlord. Nothing herein shall preclude Tenant from exercising rights to self-help and to
42 offset amounts due (subject to Tenant's offset limitations as provided in this Lease) from Landlord

4 Landlord (and in the case of any subsequent conveyances or transfers, the then grantor or
5 transferor, hereinafter collectively the "Landlord") shall be released and relieved from all obligations

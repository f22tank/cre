such revised Preliminary Tenant Plans, the procedures set forth above for revision and approval of the revised
Preliminary Tenant Plans shall be repeated until the Preliminary Tenant Plans are finally approved by Landlord and
Tenant. The Preliminary Tenant Plans, as approved by Landlord and Tenant, are referred to herein as the
"Approved Tenant Plans." The Approved Tenant Plans shall not be modified without the prior written consent of
Landlord and Tenant, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned unless such
modification requires material changes to the approving party's plans or materially increases the approving party's
costs of construction.
(B) On or before June 17, 2007, Landlord shall submit to Tenant a complete set of Landlord's
construction drawings for Landlord's Work (the "Preliminary Landlord Plans") prepared in accordance with the

Plans. Any disapproval notice shall specify, with reasonable particularity, the reasons for disapproval. If Tenant

Preliminary Landlord Plans shall be repeated until the Preliminary Landlord Plans are finally approved by Tenant and
Landlord, subject to Section 3.3. The Preliminary Landlord Plans, as approved by Tenant and Landlord, are referred
to herein as the "Approved Landlord Plans." The Approved Landlord Plans shall not be modified without the prior
written consent of Landlord and Tenant, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned
unless such modification requires material changes to the approving party's plans or materially increases the
approving party's costs of construction. If at any time after the date hereof, Tenant requests any material revisions
to the Approved Landlord Plans relating to the design and/or construction of Tenant's Storefront, and such revisions
result in Landlord incurring costs materially in excess of the costs that would otherwise be incurred by Landlord
based on the Approved Landlord Plans, Tenant shall pay the excess costs actually incurred by Landlord, provided
that Tenant approves such additional costs in writing in advance. If Tenant does not approve such costs or Landlord
reasonably believes that such revisions will materially impact Landlord's ability to complete Landlord's Work on or

Landlord shall have no obligation to make any revision to Tenant's storefront depicted in the Approved Landlord
Plans. Prior to Delivery of Possession, Landlord, upon request by Tenant, shall deliver to Tenant a copy of the most

accordance with its requirements are material inducements to Tenant to enter into this Lease. Accordingly, the
effectiveness and validity of this Lease is expressly conditioned upon the receipt of all Approvals, which condition
may be waived in writing by Tenant in Tenant's sole discretion. If either Landlord fails to obtain the Approvals
relating to Landlord's Work despite its reasonable and good faith efforts, or Tenant fails to obtain the Approvals
relating to Tenant's Work despite its reasonable and good faith efforts, then Ten ant may terminate this Lease upon
written notice to Landlord by the Anticipated Delivery Date.
(B) "Approvals" means any and all approvals, permits and variances required for the Development
Plans (and the performance of the work therein) from Landlord and all governmental or quasi-governmental

otherwise. For purposes of this Section, the Development Plans shall not be considered approved if the
Development Plans (1) are marked "disapproved" or "approved as noted," or (2) contain any conditions, notations or
requirements, or (3) the approving party fails to take any action legally required for approval, or (4) the party seeking
approval fails to obtain any necessary variance or other exemption from Legal Requirements for its plans.
(C) "Development Plans" means those portions of the Approved Landlord Plans and the Approved
Tenant Plans (as applicable) which pertain to Tenant's storefront, exterior signs and display window signs. The
Development Plans shall be in accordance with Tenant's requirements as Tenant, in its sole discretion, may
determine. Tenant shall not be required to accept or comply with any condition of approval imposed or requested
which Tenant does not, in the exercise of its sole discretion, deem acceptable. Each party shall be responsible for
ensuring that its plans comply with Legal Requirements, which may include obtaining at its cost any necessary
variance or other exemption from Legal Requirements. Neither party shall have any obligation to appeal a
disapproval of any Approval.

Landlord fails to obtain an Approval as a direct result of such material change, then Tenant shall not have the right to
terminate this Lease pursuant to this Section 3.3, provided that such Approval could have been obtained if such
material change had not been made.

Tenant's contractor to ensure timely completion of the Minor Punch list Items and prevent any disruption to Tenant's
construction schedule. If Landlord fails to complete any portion of Landlord's Work, including, without limitation,
Minor Punchlist Items, within the timeframes set forth above, then Tenant shall have the right, but not the obligation,
to complete any such work at Landlord's cost on Landlord's behalf as Landlord's agent (but Landlord shall remain
responsible for such work), in which event Landlord shall reimburse Tenant for the reasonable, documented and
actual costs incurred by Tenant within ten (10) days after receipt of an invoice therefore. If Landlord fails to pay such
costs within ten (10) days after receipt of an invoice therefore, then in addition to all other rights and remedies that

6.4 Delay in Delivery of Possession
(A) If Landlord has not satisfied the Delivery of Possession requirements by the Anticipated Delivery
Date, Landlord shall notify Tenant in writing each week of the status of Delivery of Possession requirements and the
date by which Landlord anticipates in good faith that it will satisfy the Delivery of Possession requirements, until the
Delivery of Possession requirements have been satisfied.
(B) Unless (i) a delay caused solely by Tenant, which delay has been detailed in writing and delivered
to Tenant within ten (10) days of its occurrence and prior to the Anticipated Delivery Date, whereby such delay
materially impacts Landlord ability to complete Landlord's Work in the Premises or, (ii) an event of Force Majeure

has occurred pursuant to Section 28.4, then, if Landlord has not satisfied the Delivery of Possession requirements
by the Anticipated Delivery Date or if Landlord fails to complete those aspects of Landlord's Work or the Common
Areas of tlie Shopping Center permitted to be postponed pursuant to Section 1. 7 by the applicable date for
completion set forth in Section 1.7, Landlord shall pay to Tenant as liquidated damages (and not as a penalty) the
Late Delivery Fee. If Landlord fails to pay any portion of the Late Delivery Fee within ten (10) days after demand
therefore, then in addition to all other rights and remedies that Tenant may have against Landlord (but without
duplication in recovering the amounts due Tenant), Tenant shall be entitled to deduct the unpaid and overdue
portion of the Late Delivery Fee from the Rent otherwise becoming due hereunder, together with interest on the
unpaid balance thereof at the Default Rate per annum. The parties agree that Tenant's actual damages as a result
of Landlord's late delivery would be extremely difficult or impracticable to determine, and acknowledge that the Late
Delivery Fee has been agreed upon, after negotiation, as the parties' best and reasonable estimate of Tenant's
damages.
(C) If Landlord has not satisfied the Delivery of Possession requirements within three (3) months after
the Anticipated Delivery Date (which period shall not be subject to extension due to Force Majeure but shall be
subject to delays caused by Tenant as described in Section 6.4[8]), then, in addition to Tenant's right to receive
payment of the Late Delivery Fee, Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease at anytime while such condition
continues on ten (10) days' written notice thereof to Landlord. Upon such termination, this Lease shall be of no
further force or effect ( except that Tenant shall have the right to receive payment of the Late Delivery Fee for each
day through the date of termination).
6.5 Options to Extend Term
Provided Tenant is not in default beyond all applicable notice and cure periods, Tenant shall have the
option to extend the Term for each Option Period upon the same terms and conditions as are provided for the
Original Term, except that Minimum Rent shall be as provided in Article 1. To exercise such option, Tenant must
give Landlord written notice thereof by six (6) months prior to the Natural Expiration Date. If the Term is not
extended beyond the Ori􀂛inal Term and Tenant fails to enter into a new lease at the Shopping Center or an
amendment of this Leas􀂜 or similar agreement, Tenant, as a condition to the effectiveness of the termination of the
Lease, will pay Landlord a fee of Ninety-Four Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($94,000.00) prior to the expiration of
the Term unless either an Operating Requirements Failure existed on the last day on which Tenant could have
exercised the first option, in which event Tenant shall pay Landlord a fee of Forty-Five Thousand and 00/100 Dollars
($45,000.00), or the Lease is terminated prior to the expiration of the Original Term, in which event Tenant shall not
be required to pay Landlord any such fee whatsoever. Except as set forth above, this obligation shall survive the
. termination of the Lease.

in which the CPI is determined, an adjustment shall be made in the revised index that would produce results
equivalent, as nearly as possible, to those that would be obtained hereunder if the CPI were not so revised. If the
CPI becomes unavailable because publication is discontinued or otherwise, there shall be substituted therefore a
comparable index, reasonably acceptable to both parties, based upon changes in the cost of living or the purchasing

nationally recognized financial reporting service.
7.2 Payment of Minimum Rent
Minimum Rent shall accrue commencing on the Commencement Date and shall be payable in equal
monthly installments in advance on the first day of each calendar month during the Term. Minimum Rent for any
partial calendar month during the Term shall be prorated based on a calendar year of 365 days (366 days for a leap
year), calculated by multiplying the number of days in such partial calendar month by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the applicable annual Minimum Rent and the denominator of which is 365 (366 for a leap year). With
respect to the Minimum Rent adjustments described in Article 1, Tenant shall continue to pay the Minimum Rent
payable for the month prior to the date of the Minimum Rent adjustment until the amount of the adjustment has been
determined. Promptly after the publication of the applicable CPI, Landlord shall notify Tenant in writing of the
adjusted Minimum Rent. Within one (1) month after Tenant's receipt of Landlord's Minimum Rent adjustment notice,
any overpayment of Minimum Rent shall be paid by Landlord to Tenant and any underpayment of Minimum Rent

9.1 Other Charges
ARTICLE 9: OTHER CHARGES; TENANT'S AUDIT
All payments and charges, if any, to be made hereunder by Tenant other than Minimum Rent and
Percentage Rent shall be deemed to be "Other Charges." Unless the context requires otherwise, Other Charges for
any partial calendar month during the Term shall be prorated based on a calendar year of 365 days (366 days for a
leap year), calculated by multiplying the number of days in such partial calendar month by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the applicable amount of Other Charges and the denominator of which is 365 (366 for a leap year).
Landlord shall have the same rights and remedies hereunder with respect to the collection of Other Charges as it
has with respect to the collection of Minimum Rent and Percentage Rent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Lease, Tenant shall not pay more than its proportionate share of Other Charges based on proportionate share

books, accounts and other data relating to Other Charges. Tenant or its designated agent shall have the right, no

ARTICLE 10: TAXES
10.1 Tenant's Obligation
(A) Subject to other provisions of this Article, Tenant shall pay to Landlord Tenant's Tax Share of ·

Payment". Except for the Tax Payment, Ten ant shall have no obligation to pay Taxes with respect to the Shopping
Center.
(B) "Taxes" means the ad valorem real estate taxes and Special Assessments levied or assessed
upon the Tax Parcel. Subject to other provisions of this Article, Taxes shall include assessments ("Special
Assessments") included in Landlord's real estate tax bill which are imposed by a governmental authority against the

authority and directly benefiting or serving the Tax Parcel, provided that such assessments do not include any costs
(including financing costs), whether incurred by Landlord or any governmental authority, in connection with any
capital improvements on any part of the Shopping Center or Tax Parcel, the net effect of which is to fund or finance
construction or other projects on behalf of Landlord, regardless of the designation of such costs as an "assessment"
or "special assessment" and regardless of whether such costs were incurred or financed pursuant to public
improvement bond financing, development bond financing, a special assessment district or other program
authorized by Legal Requirements or otherwise. In addition, "Pure Rent Taxes" (as hereinafter defined) shall be
considered a part of Taxes. A "Pure Rent Tax" is one which, pursuant to the wording of the tax statute or law,
applies exclusively to rentals receivable from real estate and to no other forms of receipts. A Pure Rent Tax
excludes business or gross receipts taxes. The Florida sales tax on rents and the Philadelphia use and occupancy
tax as of the date of this Lease are acknowledged as examples of a Pure Rent Tax. Taxes shall not include
penalties, interest, income taxes, profit taxes, business taxes, gross receipts taxes, capital levy taxes, inheritance
taxes, estate taxes, succession taxes, transfer taxes, gift taxes, franchise taxes, corporation taxes, documentary
stamp taxes, mortgage lien taxes, transfer gains taxes, tax increment financing or recording fees. However, Tenant
shall be responsible for paying any sales, personal or rent taxes that might be imposed.
(C) "Tax Parcel" means all tax or assessment parcels comprising the Shopping Center. If available,
Landlord shall deliver to Tenant, upon Tenant's request from time to time, a legible map of the Tax Parcel.
(D) "Tax Year" means a fiscal or calendar year for which Taxes are imposed occurring partly or wholly
within the Term.
10.2 Tenant's Tax Share
(A) "Tenant's Tax Share" means that amount, expressed as a percentage which is represented as a
fraction, the numerator of which is the GLA of the Premises and the denominator of which is the GLA of all
improvements on the Tax Parcel, as such GLA may be changed from time to time. Any change in Tenant's Tax
Share shall be effective as of the first day of the calendar month next following any change in the GLA of either the
numerator or denominator of such fraction. Landlord's estimate of Tenant's Tax Payment for the first calendar year
(on an annualized basis) is the Initial Tax Payment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Lease, Tenant
shall not pay more than its proportionate share of Taxes or other costs based on proportionate share or otherwise
subsidize any other occupant's proportionate share of Taxes or other costs based on proportionate share.
(B) If Landlord desires to exclude a Separate Parcel from the Tax Parcel, then, provided that the Tax
Payment is not increased as a result of such exclusion, Landlord may elect to exclude the Separate Parcel from the
Tax Parcel upon written notice to Tenant stating such election and providing reasonable documentation confirming
Old Navy #6349
Coleman Marketplace
16
147579.4
that the Tax Payment will not be increased as a result of such exclusion. The term "Separate Parcel" means a tax or
assessment parcel comprising a part of the Shopping Center but owned by a party other than Landlord or an Affiliate
of Landlord, for which Taxes are assessed separately from the other tax or assessment parcels comprising the
Shopping Center.
10.3 Taxes Payable Over Extended Periods
If Taxes may, at the option of the taxpayer, be paid in installments over a period longer than one (1) year,
then the same shall be deemed paid in installments over the maximum period permitted by the taxing authority and
Tenant's obligation to make its Tax Payment for any one (1) Tax Year shall only apply to those installments which
become actually due and payable (i.e., failing which payment the same would become delinquent), together with the
interest charged thereon by the governmental authority, during that same Tax Year.
10.4 Payment of Taxes
(A) Landlord shall render to Tenant, promptly after the receipt of the tax bill applicable to the Tax
Parcel for a given Tax Year, a legible copy of such tax bill and a statement showing the amount of Taxes and
indicating in reasonable detail the items included in Taxes and the computation of the Tax Payment. Tenant shall
pay its Tax Payment by the later to occur of one (1) month after Tenant's receipt thereof or one (1) month prior to the
date on which such tax bill is due; it being understood, however, that Tenant's obligation for the payment of any
Taxes during each calendar year shall apply only to Taxes which are allocable to the Tax Year then in progress (plus
any previously accrued Taxes which Tenant has not yet paid) and Tenant shall not be obligated to make any
prepayment of Taxes for Tax Years not yet in progress unless the taxing authority has billed Landlord for the same.
If Taxes are refunded after Tenant's payment, Landlord shall pay to Tenant Tenant's Tax Share of such refund.
Taxes for any fraction of a Tax Year at the commencement or expiration of the Term shall be apportioned pro rata
between the parties, with Tenant responsible only for that portion of Taxes applicable to the Term.
(8) The Tax Payment shall constitute the sole and exclusive obligation of Tenant with respect to real
estate taxes and assessments. Tenant shall have no obligation whatsoever for the payment or reimbursement of any
costs for other real estate taxes and assessments. Notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the contrary, Tenant
shall have no obligation to pay the Tax Payment unless tenants occupying at least ninety percent (90%) of the GLA
of the Shopping Center pay the same rate (or a greater rate) per-square-foot for Taxes as the rate payable by
Tenant.
10.5 Change of Ownership
If at any time during the Term there is more than two (2) change of ownerships (as defined by the Legal
Requirements) (including but not limited to any transfer or conveyance of title) of the Tax Parcel, and such change of
ownership triggers an increase in the assessed valuation of the Tax Parcel (the "Change of Ownership
Assessment"), then Tenant shall not be liable for any Taxes attributable to the Change of Ownership Assessment;
and for purposes of computing Tenant's Tax Payment commencing with the Tax Year in which the Change of
Ownership Assessment is first reflected in the taxing authorities' notice of assessment and continuing for all
subsequent Tax Years, the Taxes attributable to such change of ownership shall be subtracted from Taxes.
10.6 Tenant's Right to Contest
'If Landlord elects not to contest the Taxes and at least 25% of the GLA of the tenants or. occupants in the
Shopping Center (including the GLA of Tenant) desire the Taxes to be contested then Tenant shall have the right to
contest the amount or validity of any Taxes or to seek a reduction in the valuation of the Premises or the Tax Parcel
and to prosecute any proceedings to that end and shall give written notice thereof to Landlord. Tenant may defer
payment of such Taxes pending the outcome of such proceedings if neither the Tax Parcel nor Premises would be in
danger of being forfeited. Landlord shall not be required to join in any proceedings unless the provisions of any
Legal Requirement require such proceedings to be brought by or in the name of Landlord in which event Landlord
shall join in such proceedings or permit the same to be brought in its name. Tenant shall be entitled to a refund of
any Taxes (and penalties or interest thereon) received by Landlord which have been paid by Tenant, or which have
been paid by Landlord but previously reimbursed in full by Tenant.

12.1 Utilities
ARTICLE 12: UTILITIES
Tenant shall pay all charges for all utility services used by Tenant on the Premises. Landlord shall, at
Landlord's expense, install separate meters for electricity and any other utility serving the Premises, except that
water and sewer service to the Premises shall be submetered at Landlord's expense. For any utility that is
separately metered, Tenant shall contract directly with, and shall pay all charges for such utility service directly to,
the applicable utility company. For any utility services that are submetered or billed with other premises, Tenant's
charge for such utility shall not exceed Tenant's Utility Share of Landlord's actual costs for such utility, excluding any
administrative or other surcharge added by Landlord or Landlord's Agents and further excluding the cost of such
utility for any occupant who uses an extraordinary amount of such utility. "Tenant's Utility Share" means that amount,
expressed as a percentage which is represented as a fraction, the numerator of which is the GLA of the Premises
and the denominator of which is the GLA of those premises using such utility, but adjusted proportionately for any
premises whose occupant.uses an extraordinary amount of such utility. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Lease, Tenant's charge for any utility for which Tenant's consumption is metered or can be reasonably
estimated shall not exceed the product of the amount of units consumed by Tenant multiplied by the lesser of the
rate per unit actually paid by Landlord to the utility provider or the rate per unit otherwise competitively available to
Tenant in the area. Tenant shall have the right to install a separate meter or submeter for any utility. Tenant shall
have no obligation to use any utilities offered by Landlord, including, without limitation, electrical or data transmission
services, and shall have the right to select the utility companies serving the Premises. If any utilities supplied by
Landlord are disrupted due to the negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord or Landlord's Agents, Rent shall abate
to the extent to which such disruption interferes with the conduct by Tenant of its business. If such disruption
interferes with the conduct by Tenant of its business to such an extent that Tenant, in the exercise of its reasonable
business judgment, closes the Premises for business, then Rent shall totally abate for each day or portion thereof
that such disruption continues. Landlord may discontinue such service only upon the later to occur of three (3)
months after Tenant's receipt of notice from Landlord or the date on which comparable service is otherwise available
to Tenant, but in no event shall Landlord permit such discontinuance to disrupt Tenant's business.
12.2 Trash Removal

Landlord's Agents, a trash compactor and reasonable number of trash receptacles sufficient to contain Tenant's
trash. Tenant shall contract directly with a service provider of its choice for its trash removal services, and shall be
responsible for payment of such services directly to such provider.

(C) Tenant may elect, in its sole discretion, to open the Premises for business prior to the fulfillment of
the Opening Requirements, but such action shall not waive the Opening Requirements or Landlord's obligations or
Ten ant's rights with respect to the Delivery of Possession requirements. If Tenant elects to open the Premises for
business prior to the fulfillment of the Opening Requirements, then the Commencement Date shall be deemed to
have occurred on the date Tenant opens the Premises for business. During the period from the Commencement
Date until the fulfillment of the Opening Requirements (the "Interim Period"), Tenant shall pay to Landlord as a
substitute rent (the "Interim Rent") for such Interim Period, in lieu of regular Minimum Rent, Percentage Rent and
Other Charges, an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the amount of Minimum Rent then applicable. From and
after the fulfillment of the Opening Requirements, Tenant shall cease the payment of Interim Rent and commence
the payment of regular Rent computed in the way and manner as provided by this Lease accruing from and after the
date the Opening Requirements were met.
(D) If the Opening Requirements are not met for a period of twelve (12) months after the
Commencement Date (or, if the Commencement Date has not occurred, twelve (12) months after the expiration of
the Construction Period), then commencing on the first (1st) day of the thirteenth ( 13th) month after the
Commencement Date (or, if the Commencement Date has not occurred, on the first (1st) day of the thirteenth (13th)
month after the expiration of the Construction Period) and continuing until the Opening Requirements are met,
Tenant shall have the right at any time to terminate this Lease by written notice to Landlord, which termination shall
be effective as of a date which shall be specified in Tenant's notice of termination, provided that such date shall be
no less than one (1) month following receipt by Landlord of such notice. Upon Landlord's receipt of such termination
notice, Tenant's termination shall not be affected or nullified by the fact that the Opening Requirements are later met
prior to the effective date of the termination unless Tenant, in its sole discretion, elects to revoke its termination
notice and reinstate this Lease.
(E) If Tenant fails to terminate this Lease on or before the expiration of Termination Period, then such
termination right shall automatically lapse and Tenant shall have no further rights under this Section 14.2, and upon
the first day of the fifteenth (15th) month after the failure of the Opening Requirements, Tenant shall commence the
payment of Rent subject to the other terms of this Lease and provided that any waiting period under the Lease
before which Tenant may exercise its rights shall be deemed to have expired.
(F) Intentionally Deleted.
(G) Tenant or its designated agent shall have the right at its own cost and expense to audit and
inspect Landlord's records with respect to the Opening Requirements upon not less than ten (10) days' written notice
to Landlord. If Tenant's audit or other investigation discloses a violation of the Opening Requirements, Landlord shall
promptly pay Tenant any Rent paid in excess of the Interim Rent for the Interim Period or, at Tenant's election,
Tenant may offset the amount of the overcharge against Rent becoming due.
14.3 Operating Requirements
(A) The "Operating Requirements" are satisfied only when (i) Target, plus (ii) three (3) of the other Key
Stores, plus (iii) Retailers (excluding the Premises, the three (3) largest Key Stores (i.e., the three (3) Key Stores
with the largest GLA that are open for business) and temporary stores) having an aggregate of.fifty percent (50%) or
more of the total GLA of the Shopping Center (excluding the GLA of the Premises: the three (3) largest Key Stores
and temporary stores) are open for business. An "Operating Requirements Failure" occurs when the Operating
Requirements are not satisfied.
(B) Promptly upon Tenant's request from time to time (but not more often than twice per Lease Year),
Landlord shall deliver to Tenant a notice certifying, to the best of Landlord's knowledge, for the dates requested by
Tenant, (1) the then current trade name and GLA of each tenant of the Shopping Center, (2) the commencement of
any Excused Closure occurring on such dates, (3) that the Operating Requirements are satisfied or, if not satisfied,
the date on which the Operating Requirements Failure occurred, (4) all periods during the Term during which the
Old Navy #6349

147579.4
Operating Requirements were not satisfied, and (5) any other information or documentation reasonably requested by
Tenant to confirm the satisfaction of the Operating Requirements. Tenant shall have the right to rely on such
certification without further inquiry. If Landlord fails to deliver such notice to Tenant within ten (10) days after
Tenant's second (2"d) request for such certification and Tenant reasonably and in good faith believes that the
Operating Requirements are satisfied, Tenant shall hold any Rent in excess of the Alternate Rent until Landlord has
delivered such notice and any such dispute is resolved.
(C) Tenant or its designated agent shall have the right at its own cost and expense to audit and
inspect Landlord's records with respect to the Operating Requirements upon not less than ten (10) days' written
notice to Landlord. If an audit or other investigation discloses a violation of the Operating Requirements, Landlord
shall promptly pay Tenant any Rent paid in excess of the Alternate Rent for the period of the Operating
Requirements Failure or, at Tenant's election, Tenant may offset the amount of the overcharge against Rent
becoming due, except for any period during which Tenant desires to be deemed to have exercised the Closure
Right.

(A) If an Operating Requirements Failure occurs for a continuous period of three (3) months (or occurs
for a continuous period of six (6) months if the Operating Requirements Failure is caused by (A) a Retailer occupying
more than fifty thousand (50,000) square feet of GLA, or (B) a Retailer operating under the trade name "Dick's
Sporting Goods"), then, effective immediately and provided that Tenant is not closed, Tenant shall pay monthly, as
"Alternate Rent" during the period of the Operating Requirements Failure, in lieu of regular Minimum Rent,
Percentage Rent and Other Charges, an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the amount of Minimum Rent then
applicable (the "Alternate Rent Right"). If Tenant exercises the Alternate Rent Right for more than one (1) year for
any specific Operating Requirements Failure and at least fifty percent (50%) of the total GLA of the Shopping Center
(other than the Premises) is open for business during the Minimum Times, Landlord may deliver to Tenant a notice
stating the date on which the Operating Requirements Failure occurred and revoking Tenant's right to pay Alternate
Rent for the remainder of such Operating Requirements Failure, in which event Tenant shall, within one (1) month
after receipt of Landlord's revocation notice, commence payment of full Rent retroactively as of the date of Tenant's
receipt of Landlord's revocation notice, provided that Tenant shall have the right to pay Alternate Rent again if (i) the
Operating Requirements Failure continues for more than two (2) years, or (ii) a different Operating Requirements
Failure occurs, or (iii) less than fifty percent (50%) of the total GLA of the Shopping Center (other than the Premises)
is open for business during the Minimum Times.
(8) If an Operating Requirements Failure occurs, then, effective immediately, Tenant may close the
Premises for business and, during such period of closure, Tenant shall pay Minimum Rent in lieu of all other Rent
and perform all of such other obligations as are applicable to a vacant premises (the "Closure Right"). The exercise
by Tenant of the Closure Right shall not disqualify or affect Tenant's right to terminate this Lease pursuant to this
Article 14 or otherwise.
(C) If the Operating Requirements are not met for a continuous period of six (6) months, then, in
addition to the Alternate Rent Right and the Closure Right, Tenant shall have the right anytime thereafter while such
condition exists to terminate this Lease by written notice to Landlord, which termination shall be effective as of a
date which shall be specified in Tenant's notice of termination, provided that such date shall .be no less than one (1)
month following receipt by Landlord of such notice (the "Termination Right"). Once such Termination Right has been
Old Navy #6349
Coleman Marketplace
22
147579.4
exercised by Tenant, Tenant's termination shall not be affected or nullified by the fact that the Operating
Requirements have once again been met prior to the effective date of the termination unless Tenant, in its sole
discretion, elects to revoke its termination notice and reinstate this Lease.
(D) Promptly after an Operating Requirements Failure is cured, Landlord shall certify in writing to
Tenant that the Operating Requirements Failure was cured and the date on which the Operating Requirements
Failure was cured and deliver to Tenant evidence reasonably acceptable to Tenant that the Operating Requirements
were satisfied. An Operating Requirements Failure shall not be deemed to have been cured if the same Operating
Requirements Failure re-occurs or a different Operating Requirements Failure occurs within one (1) month after the
initial Operating Requirements Failure was cured. If Tenant is pursuing the Alternate Rent Right, Tenant shall, within
one (1) month after receipt of Landlord's certification, commence payment of full Rent retroactively as of the date on
which the Operating Requirements Failure was cured.
14.5 Substitution
If Landlord desires to replace a Key Store vacating its premises with another Retailer for purposes of
satisfying the Operating Requirements, Landlord shall submit the name of such substitute Retailer to Tenant for its
prior written approval. The approval of Tenant shall not be unreasonably withheld if: (A) the use to be conducted by
the substitute Retailer is substantially the same as that conducted by the vacating Key Store; (B) the quality, fashion
level and retail price of the merchandise sold by the substitute Retailer is equal to, or better than, that of the vacating
Key Store (or, if the vacating Key Store closed under circumstances of distress proceedings, such as bankruptcy or
foreclosure proceedings, or the price structure of such merchandise was lowered to distress or "going out of
business" sale levels, then the quality, fashion level and retail price shall be equal to, or better than, that which
existed prior to such proceedings or lowered price structure); (C) the substitute Retailer is a national or regional
Retailer with at least five (5) stores operating under the same trade name; and (D) the substitute Retailer operates
for retail purposes in at least ninety percent (90%) of the GLA of the vacating Key Store's premises, provided that, if
the vacating Key Store occupies more than 50,000 square feet of GLA, such substitute Retailer shall only be
required to operate for retail purposes in at least eighty percent (80%) of the GLA of the vacating Key Store's
premises. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord may replace a Key Store vacating its premises with another
Retailer for purposes of satisfying the Operating Requirements without Tenant's consent if: (i) the substitute Retailer
is one of the national or regional Retailers identified on Exhibit G (the "Substitute Key Store List"); (ii) such
substitute Retailer is required to open and operate for retail purposes in at least ninety percent (90%) of the GLA of
the vacating Key Store's premises under the trade name identified on the Substitute Key Store List, provided that, if
such vacating Key Store occupies more than 50,000 square feet of GLA, such substitute Retailer shall only be
required to operate for retail purposes in at least eighty percent (80%) of the GLA of the vacating Key Store's
premises under the trade name identified on the Substitute Key Store List; and (iii) Landlord notifies Tenant in writing
of the substitution promptly following the execution of such substitute Retailer's lease and provides evidence
reasonably acceptable to Tenant that the conditions for such substitution were met. Tenant's right of approval under
this Section is solely for the purpose of determining whether the substitute Retailer qualifies as a Key Store under
this Article, and is not intended to impair or restrict the freedom of Landlord to enter into leases or operating
agreements with any party with whom Landlord desires in the exercise of its sole and absolute discretion.
14.6 Limitations
(A) For purposes of this Article, a Retailer (including a Key Store) shall not be deemed to be open for
business if (1) such Retailer is open and operating for less than the Minimum Times, or (2) such Retailer is open and
operating for retail purposes in less than ninety percent (90%) of the GLA of its premises, or (3) the initial term of the
lease for such Retailer is less than five (5) years. A "Retailer" means a business open to the public whose principal
use of its premises is the retail sale of merchandise or services to customers within its premises, including retail
stores, department stores, restaurants, food and beverage establishments and banks. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, a "Retailer" excludes hotels and other vendors of sleeping accommodations; skating rinks, raceways, gokart
tracks and vendors of similar amusements, and vendors of professional services such as doctors, dentists, real
estate brokers, lawyers, accountants and tax advisers. The "Minimum Times" means the greater of (i) the days and
hours of the Shopping Center designated by Landlord or (ii) from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. everyday except Easter Sunday,
Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day or New Years Day.
(8) For purposes of the Operating Requirements only, a Retailer which is closed by reason of material
casualty, temporary condemnation or the making of material repairs or alterations (collectively, an "Excused
Closure") shall be excluded from the total GLA of the Shopping Center during such Excused Closure, not to exceed
two (2) months, provided that any waiting period before which Tenant may exercise its remedies pursuant hereto
shall be deemed to run concurrently with such Excused Closure.

ARTICLE 15: MAINTENANCE
15.1 Landlord's Repairs
(A) Except for repairs specifically required herein to be made by Tenant and subject to Articles 20 and
21 and repairs that are otherwise required under this Lease due to Tenant's actions or inactions, Landlord shall at all
times, at its sole cost and expense, keep, replace and maintain in good condition, order and repair:
Premises;
(1) all portions of the buildings and improvements of the Shopping Center other than the
(2) all portions of the roof, roof structures, supports and walkpads (including Tenant's interior
ceiling damaged from leaking), and all structural portions of the Premises, including but not limited to, the foundation
and structural supports, exterior and load bearing walls, floors (but not floor coverings), gutters, downspouts and
exterior doors;
(3) all other portions of the Premises which constitute Landlord's Work for a period of one (1)
year from the date of completion thereof or for the period of the warranties of Landlord's contractors, whichever is
longer;
(4) all utilities to the point of entry to the Premises;
(5) all driveways, sidewalks, parking areas and all other Common Areas of the Shopping
Center, including the removal of snow and ice there from;
(6) latent defects in the Premises as well as any damage to the Premises caused by the
willful act or the negligence of Landlord or Landlord's Agents.
(B) The Construction Period shall be extended by one day for each day (or portion thereon of delay in
the performance of Tenant's Work caused by a failure to repair items for which Landlord is responsible.
15.2 Tenant's Right to Cure
Landlord shall commence and complete all repairs within the Premises as soon as is reasonably possible
under the circumstances, but in any event within fifteen (20) days after receipt of notice from Tenant of the need for
such repair, provided however that if the nature of such repair is such that it cannot reasonably be completed within
such 15-day period, then, upon notice to Tenant, Landlord shall have such additional time as is reasonably required
to complete such repair provided Landlord commences to perform the repair within such 15-day period and
proceeds to completion with diligence and continuity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord shall commence and
complete all repairs immediately upon oral notice from Tenant in the event of an emergency. An "emergency" as
used in this Lease means the threat of immediate injury or damage to persons or property or the immediate
imposition of a civil or criminal fine or penalty. If Landlord fails to perform its obligations as set forth above, Tenant,
after delivering notice to Landlord, may perform the repairs on Landlord's behalf as Landlord's agent (but Landlord
shall remain responsible for such work). Landlord acknowledges that there could exist an emergency situation in
which Tenant does not have the ability to notify Landlord and accordingly, Tenant may immediately commence
repairs that would be Landlord's responsibility and notify Landlord promptly after such repairs have been
undertaken. Landlord grants Tenant and Tenant's Agents the right to enter into any space located adjacent to or
above the Premises that is reasonably necessary for Tenant to perform such repairs, including the roof, provided
that Landlord may require Tenant to be escorted during such entry. If such repairs require access to space that is
leased or occupied by an entity other than Landlord or Landlord's Agents, Landlord shall exercise all remedies
available, including the commencement of legal proceedings, to ensure Tenant access to such space to complete
such repairs. If Tenant undertakes such repairs, Landlord shall reimburse Tenant for the actual reasonable and
documented costs incurred by Tenant within thirty (30) days' after receipt of an invoice therefore. If Landlord fails to
pay such costs within thirty (30) days' after receipt of an invoice therefore, then in addition to all other rights and
remedies that Tenant may have against Landlord (but without duplication in recovering the amounts due Tenant),
Tenant shall be entitled to deduct the unpaid and overdue amount of such costs from up to fifty percent (50%) of the
Rent otherwise becoming due hereunder, together with interest on the unpaid balance thereof at the Default Rate
per annum.
15.3 Entry by Landlord
(A) Tenant shall permit Landlord and its representatives to enter the Premises at all reasonable times
for the purpose of inspection, making repairs required to be made by Landlord pursuant to Section 15.1 and to
comply with Legal Requirements. All rights of Landlord hereunder shall be exercised in a reasonable manner and so
as to cause as little interference with Tenant's business as is reasonably possible, and in accordance with this
Section.
Old Navy #6349

147579.4
(B) Subsequent to Delivery of Possession, Landlord's right of access to the Premises shall also be
subject to the following conditions:
(1) Landlord shall give Tenant at least two (2) days' prior written notice of the need for such
entry, except in emergencies and shall specify the estimated time required for such work.
(2) No change or alteration may be made to the storefront of the Premises or the size, area,
height, dimensions or configuration of the Premises.
(3) No columns, beams, girders, braces, supports (collectively, "Supports") or shafts of any
kind may be installed in the Premises except to replace existing Supports or shafts. Replacements must be in the
exact location of the item replaced and must be no larger in size or dimensions than such replaced item.
(4) All pipes, ducts, utility lines, conduits or equipment ("Utility Lines") shall be located
completely beneath the floor of the Premises or completely within the walls or completely above Tenant's hung
ceiling in non-stockroom areas, provided however that, if no finished ceiling is installed by Ten ant in the nonstockroom
portions of the Premises, such ceiling area shall not be available to Landlord for this purpose. If no
ceiling is present in the stockroom area, then such Utility Lines shall be located at a height no lower than twelve
feet (12') from the finished floor of such area. Utility Lines placed in the Premises may not displace or interfere with
the location or placement of Tenant's Utility Lines serving the Premises; it being understood that Tenant's Utility
Lines have priority in their location in the Premises.
(5) Such work shall be performed during hours that Tenant is not open for business (except
in emergencies) unless Tenant shall otherwise agree and then subject to such reasonable limitations as Tenant may
impose. If Landlord's work is expected to exceed two (2) days, then such work may not be performed during the
period from August 31 through December 31 of any given year except for emergencies, fire or other casualty,
eminent domain or to comply with specific deadlines imposed by Legal Requirements.
(6) Any restoration work or alteration work at the Premises which is necessitated by or
results from Landlord's entry, including, without limitation, any work necessary to conceal any element whose
presence is permitted hereunder, shall be performed by Landlord at its expense or, at Tenant's election, by Tenant
on Landlord's behalf and at Landlord's sole cost and expense.
(7) Landlord shall indemnify, defend and hold Tenant harmless from and against any and all
Indemnified Costs relating to Landlord's entry.
(8) If Landlord's entry into the Premises pursuant to this Lease or the performance of any
work in the Common Areas in front of or adjacent to the Premises interferes with the conduct by Tenant of its
business, or any other work in the Common Areas materially impacts customer traffic to the Shopping Center or
Tenant's ability to operate for business, Rent shall abate to the extent to which such actions interfere with the
conduct or operation by Tenant of its business. If such actions interfere with Tenant's business to such an extent
that Tenant, in the exercise of its reasonable business judgment, closes the Premises for business for more than (3)
days, then Rent shall totally abate for each day or portion thereof that such interference continues and Tenant shall
provide Landlord notice of such closure. If Tenant remains closed for business by reason of such interference for
more than ten (10) days (which period shall not be subject to extension by reason of Force Majeure), Tenant shall
have the continuing right thereafter and prior to the cessation of such interference to terminate this Lease upon
five (5) days' prior written notice to Landlord. Tenant shall have the right to re-enter the Premises following the
cessation of the interference to remove Tenant's Personal Property.
(C) At any time within the six (6) months immediately preceding the expiration of the Term, Landlord
may, upon-twenty-four (24) hours' prior written notice to Tenant, show the Premises to prospective tenants and may,
during such period, affix to any reasonably suited part of the Premises (but not in or upon a display window) a notice
which is reasonable in size for letting or selling the Premises.
15.4 Tenant's Repairs
Subject to Article 17, 20 and 21, Tenant shall keep the interior non-structural portions of the Premises
(including all building systems located within the Premises for which Tenant is responsible), in good condition, order
and repair, including repairs and replacements to the HVAC system exclusively serving the Premises, except those
conditions covered under any warranties of Landlord's contractors and ordinary wear and tear. Tenant shall
promptly replace all damaged plate glass windows and other glass forming part of the Premises with glass of the
same quality and strength. In the event of a conflict between the terms of this Section and the terms of Articles 17,
20 and 21, the terms of Articles 17, 20 and 21 shall control.

customarily issued in the jurisdiction, then upon the full completion of Landlord's Work and Tenant's Work), Tenant
shall be responsible only for complying with Legal Requirements within the Premises that are Tenant Generated or
non-structural,. Landlord shall be solely responsible for compliance with all other Legal Requirements, which are

performed by Tenant or Tenant's Agents or by the particular nature of Tenant's use (i.e. "apparel sales" as
distinguished from "general retail") or by the particular manner in which Tenant conducts its permitted use, an
omission of Tenant or a default by Tenant of any of the terms of this Lease. If Tenant is required to install a sprinkler
system for the Premises as a result of a Tenant Generated Legal Requirement after the issuance of the initial
certificate of occupancy for the Premises, then Landlord shall install, at its sole cost, an operational sprinkler main to
an appropriate point of entry into the Premises ready for Tenant's hookup, and Tenant shall install, at its sole cost,
the balance of the sprinkler system within the Premises.
17.1 Alterations
ARTICLE 17: ALTERATIONS
Tenant may at any time during the Term, at its own expense, make or cause to be made any interior
alterations, additions, removals or improvements (collectively, "Alterations") which are non-structural in nature upon
or to the interior of the Premises, as Tenant deems desirable without Landlord's consent. Tenant may at any time
during the Term, at its own expense, make or cause to be made any Alterations which are structural or exterior in
nature, provided that Tenant has obtained Landlord's approval therefore (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned). Tenant, at its own expense, may also erect, install and remove at any time during
the Term any Tenant's Personal Property and signs in the Premises as it deems desirable for the purpose of
conducting its business. Tenant, at its own expense, may also erect, install and remove at any time during the Term

items in or about the Premises, regardless of who performed or paid for such installation, expressly
excluding Tenant's trade fixtures, furniture, point of sale system, merchandise and personal property (collectively,
"Tenant's Personal Property"). The ownership of Tenant's Personal Property and Tenant's signs shall remain at all
times in Tenant. The ownership interest of any safety systems (such as, without limitation, fire and security

expense, to contest or protest any claim relating to such lien. If such lien is filed against the Premises, Tenant shall,
within one (1) month after notice from Landlord of its filing, bond over such lien. In the event of any contest or
protest of such lien by Tenant (and provided that Tenant has bonded-over such lien), Landlord shall not pay the

Causes of Loss Special Form (including rent loss) insuring the buildings and improvements of the Shopping Center,
including the Premises and the Improvements, in an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the full

the above insurance coverage (the "Insurance Costs"), which annual sum is estimated in Section 1.20.
18.2 Tenant's Insurance

18.3 Waiver of Subrogation
Each party, on behalf of itself and on behalf of anyone claiming under or through it by way of subrogation or
otherwise, waives all rights and causes of action against the other party and such party's Agents and invitees for any
liability arising out of any loss or damage in or to the Premises, the Shopping Center and the contents therein
caused by: (A) any peril normally covered under " All Risk" Special Form policies described in Article 18 (whether or
not such party actually carries such insurance policies); or (B) if the scope of coverage is broader than in (A) above,
then any peril actually covered under the property insurance maintained by such party. Notwithstanding the
provisions set forth in this Section, the waiver of subrogation contained herein shall apply only to any loss or damage
in excess of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00) per occurrence. This release and waiver shall be
complete and total even if such loss or damage may have been caused by the negligence of the other party or such
party's Agents or invitees and shall not be affected or limited by the amount of insurance proceeds available to the
waiving party, regardless of the reason for such deficiency in proceeds. If one party's insurance carrier prohibits
waiver of subrogation, then each party's release and waiver shall become null and void as each waiver is given in
consideration for the other. Each party covenants that, from and after Delivery of Possession, its insurance policies
will contain waiver of subrogation endorsements, and, if such endorsements for any reason are about to become
unavailable, it will give the other party not less than one (1) month's prior written notice of such impending
unavailability. Any limitation on the scope of Landlord's waiver of its rights pursuant to this Section shall in no event
be deemed to apply to, nor shall Tenant's rights and benefits under such waiver be impaired or diminished by, a

Landlord's election to self-insure; (2) Landlord's election to carry insurance in an amount less than one hundred
percent (100%) of replacement cost; (3) any deductible under any insurance carried by Landlord, or (4) any amount
of insurance proceeds appropriated by Landlord's mortgagee or holder of a superior interest in such proceeds.

receipt of written notice from Landlord that the same is overdue;
(2) the failure by Tenant to perform or observe any other term or condition of this Lease
within one (1) month after Tenant's receipt of written notice thereof from Landlord; provided however that if the
nature of such failure is such that it cannot reasonably be cured within such 1-month period (an "Excused Delay"),

23.2 Remedies of Landlord
(A) Upon an Event of Default by Tenant, Landlord may, subject to Legal Requirements and the first
sentence of Section 23.2(8) below, by at least five (5) days' prior written notice to Tenant:
(1) declare this Lease terminated, in which event this Lease shall terminate with the same
force and effect as though the date set forth in the notice of termination were the date originally set forth herein for
the expiration of the Term, and Tenant shall vacate and surrender the Premises but shall remain liable (subject to
the limitations set forth in this Section) for all obligations arising during the balance of the Term;
(2)
(3)

without terminating this Lease, terminate Tenant's right to possession of the Premises; or
without terminating Tenant's right to possession of the Premises, continue this Lease in
(B) Landlord hereby expressly waives any and all "self help" remedies (i.e., remedies not obtained
from a court) which may be available to Landlord pursuant to Legal Requirements. Notwithstanding the foregoing
and regardless of Landlord's election to pursue any of the remedies described above or such other remedies as are
allowed at law, Landlord's remedy or recovery for the collection of Rent past due or to become due under this Lease
shall be limited exclusively to either of the following: (1) without re-entry into the Premises, Landlord may institute
suit from time to time for the recovery of past due Rent, or (2) Landlord may re-enter the Premises pursuant to
process of law and dispossess Tenant and all other occupants there from (subject to Section 23.3) and remove and

as may be necessary in order to relet the Premises, and may relet the Premises or any part thereof for such term
(which may be for a term extending beyond the Term) and at such rental and upon such other terms and conditions
as Landlord may deem advisable. Upon each reletting all rentals and other sums received by Landlord there from
shall be applied in the following order:
(1) to the payment of any indebtedness other than Rent due hereunder;
(2) to the payment of any costs and expenses of such reletting including reasonable
brokerage fees and costs of such alterations and repairs (collectively, "Other Damages");

147579.4
(3) to the payment of Rent past due and unpaid; and
(4) the residue, if any, shall be held by Landlord and applied in payment of future Rent, which
shall continue to accrue upon the days that the same would otherwise have become due and payable hereunder if
no Event of Default had occurred.
(D) If such rentals and other sums received from such reletting during any month are less than Rent to
be paid during·that month by Tenant hereunder, Tenant shall pay such deficiency to Landlord. Any such deficiency
shall be calculated and paid monthly. If such rentals and sums shall be more than Rent, Tenant shall have no right
to the excess but shall be entitled to a credit in the amount of such excess against Rent to become due in the future.
Landlord shall use reasonable efforts to mitigate damages and relet the Premises without preference to any other
vacant space in the Shopping Center. Landlord's statutory or common law lien and right of distraint, if any, are
hereby waived.
(E) Whether or not this Lease or Tenant's right to possession is terminated by Landlord .or by any ·
provision of law or court decree, Tenant shall have no obligation to pay any Rent until the date it would otherwise
have become due in the absence of any Event of Default. Landlord shall have no right to accelerate (i.e. declare the
same immediately due and payable) any Rent which would have become due in the future ("Future Rent"). In the
event Landlord terminates this Lease, Tenant's liability for Future Rent (as well as any damages specifically in lieu of
or representing such Future Rent) shall cease except to the extent and manner provided in Subsection 23.2(8).

Landlord shall be in default of this Lease if Landlord fails to perform any of its obligations under this Lease
within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice from Tenant specifying such failure in the case of monetary
obligations owed by Landlord to Tenant or one (1) month after receipt of written notice from Tenant specifying such
failure in the case of non-monetary obligations, provided however that if the nature of such default is such that it
cannot reasonably be cured within such period, then, upon notice to Tenant, Landlord shall have such additional
time as is reasonably required to cure such default provided that Landlord commences to cure the default within
such period and proceeds to complete such cure with diligence and continuity. If Landlord fails to perform its
obligations as set forth above or in the event of an emergency, Tenant may, at its option, in addition to any other
remedies at law or equity, incur any expense necessary to perform the obligations of Landlord specified in such
notice on Landlord's behalf as Landlord's agent (but Landlord shall remain responsible for such work), in which
event Landlord shall reimburse Tenant for the actual reasonable and documented costs incurred by Tenant within
thirty (30) days after receipt of an invoice therefore. If Landlord fails to pay such costs within thirty (30) days after
receipt of an invoice therefore, then in addition to all other rights and remedies that Tenant may have against
Landlord (but without duplication in recovering the amounts due Tenant), Tenant shall be entitled to deductthe
unpaid and overdue amount of such costs from up to fifty percent (50%) of the Minimum Rent otherwise becoming
due hereunder, together with interest on the unpaid balance thereof at the Default Rate per annum. An "emergency"
as used in this Lease means the threat of immediate injury or damage to persons or property or the immediate
imposition of a civil or criminal fine or penalty.

Agreement provides that, in the event of a foreclosure, sale under a power of sale, ground or master lease
termination or transfer in lieu of any of the foregoing or the exercise of any other remedy pursuant to any such
Encumbrance (a "Foreclosure"), then (A) Tenant's use, possession and enjoyment of the Premises shall not be
disturbed and this Lease shall continue in full force and effect so long as no Event of Default on the part of Tenant
has occurred, and (8) this Lease shall automatically and unconditionally become a direct lease between any
successor to Landlord's interest, as landlord, and Tenant as if such successor were the landlord originally named
hereunder. In addition to all rights and remedies available to Tenant for Landlord's failure to deliver the NonDisturbance
Agreement, if Tenant has not received the Non-Disturbance Agreement duly executed by Landlord and
each holder of an Encumbrance upon the commencement of any Foreclosure, Tenant shall have the right to
terminate this Lease upon five (5) days' prior written notice, notwithstanding the election of the holder of the
Encumbrance to make this Lease superior to the lien of the Encumbrance.

Landlord waives all claims against Tenant for any sums so paid at the direction of the holder of any Encumbrance.
Tenant may conclusively rely upon any written notice Tenant receives from the holder of any Encumbrance,
notwithstanding any claims by Landlord contesting the validity of any term or condition of such notice, inclu􀂷ing any

(B) In no event shall the issuance of such certificate subject Tenant to any liability whatsoever, despite
the negligent or otherwise inadvertent failure of Tenant to disclose correct or relevant information, or constitute a
waiver with respect to any act of Landlord for which approval by Tenant was required but not sought or obtained,
provided that, as between Tenant and the third party recipient to whom such certificate is addressed, Tenant shall be

affect of the opening, operation, merchandising or closing of such stores, and further regardless of any obligations or
rights based on the sales generated at the Premises expressly set forth in this Lease. Without limiting the generality

Coleman Marketplace
36
147579.4

the request. If the party whose approval or consent has been requested fails to notify the other party of its approval
or disapproval within twenty (20) days after receipt of the request and continues to fail to notify the other party of its
approval or disapproval within ten (10) days after receipt of a copy of the original request and a notice containing
verbatim the following: "If you fail to respond to this request within ten (10) days of your receipt of this notice, your
request shall automatically be deemed to have been approved in accordance with the Lease", then the request shall
automatically be deemed to have been approved.
28.12 Interpretation
All obligations of either party to indemnify the other shall survive the expiration or early termination of this
Lease. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof. There are no promises, agreements, conditions, undertakings, warrants, representations, whether oral or
written, between the parties except as set forth in this Lease. This Lease supersedes all previous agreements
between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. Except as set forth in this Agreement, there are no
representations, warranties or agreements between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This
Agreement cannot be modified, supplemented, or amended except by an instrument in writing signed by both
parties. Each party agrees that this Lease is the result of good faith negotiations and shall be interpreted as though it
were drafted by both parties. This Lease shall be interpreted and construed in accordance with the laws of the
jurisdiction in which the Premises are located. Nothing in this Lease shall be interpreted to create a partnership or
joint venture between Landlord and Tenant. The waiver of an Event of Default by either party must be express and
in writing and shall not constitute a waiver of a subsequent Event of Default. In the event that any provision of this
Lease is declared by any court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision
shall be null and void and shall be deemed deleted from this Lease and all remaining provision of this Lease shall
remain in full force and effect. The locative adverbs "herein," "hereunder," "hereto," "hereby," "hereinafter," or others
similar thereto mean this Lease in its entirety and not to any specific Article, Section, or other subdivision of this
Lease. A "year" means a period of 365 consecutive days (366 consecutive days for a leap year). For example, a
year commencing on January 15, 2002 will end on January 14, 2003. A "calendar year" means a period of January
1 through December 31 of the same year. A "month" means a period of 28 consecutive days (if the month in which
the monthly period commences contains 28 days), 29 consecutive days (if the month in which the monthly period
commences contains 29 days), 30 consecutive days (if the month in which the monthly period commences contains
30 days) or 31 consecutive days (if the month in which the monthly period commences contains 31 days). For
example, one (1) month commencing on January 15, 2002 ends on February 14, 2002, and a four (4) month period
commencing on April 21, 2002 ends on August 20, 2002. A "calendar month" means a period commencing on the
first day of a particular month and ending on the last day of the same month. A "week" means a period of seven (7)
days. Titles, headings and subheadings are intended only for ease of review and shall not be used for purposes of
interpreting any provision of this Lease.
28.13 Landlord's Exculpation
If Landlord shall fail to perform any covenant, term or condition of this Lease upon Landlord's part to be
performed, and if as a consequence of such default Tenant shall recover a money judgment against Landlord, such
judgment shall be satisfied only out of the proceeds of sale received upon execution of such judgment and levied
thereon against the right, title and interest of Landlord in the Property and the assets of the partnership which
constitutes the Landlord hereunder and out of rents, issues or other income from such property receivable by
Landlord, or out of the consideration received by Landlord from the sale or other disposition of all or any part of
Landlord's right, title and interest in the Property or other partnership assets. Nothing contained herein shall limit or
affect any right that Tenant might otherwise have to obtain injunctive relief or other remedies or actions against
Landlord which does not involve the personal liability of the Landlord and/or of the partners of the partnership which
comprises the Landlord to respond in monetary damages from property other than Landlord's interest in the
Shopping Center and the assets of the partnership. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitation of this
Section 28.13 to claims for monetary damages shall not apply to or limit (1) any injunctive or other equitable,
declaratory or other forms of relief to which Tenant may be entitled (notwithstanding that such actions are
in personam in nature) which relief may include (A) the recovery of money damages awarded by the court as
incident to such equitable or other relief, and (B) the expenditure of money by Landlord in order to comply with the
equitable decree or other relief or reimburse Tenant for any loss on account of Landlord's failure or inability to
comply therewith or cost of enforcement thereof, or (2) or in any suit or action in connection with enforcement or
collection of amounts which may become owing or payable under or on account of insurance maintained by
Landlord. If Landlord transfers it interest in this Lease, except as collateral security, then, upon such transfer,
Landlord shall be released from all liability and obligations under this Lease accruing after such transfer, provided
that the transferee assumes all such liability and obligations.
28.14 Disputes and Waiver of Right to Jury Trial
(A) If either party brings an action against the other to enforce or interpret the terms of this Lease or
otherwise arising out of or in connection with this Lease, the prevailing party in such action shall be entitled to its
Old Navy #6349
Coleman Marketplace
37
147579.4
costs of suit and reasonable attorney's fees. The term "prevailing party" means that party, as either plaintiff or
defendant, who substantially prevails against the other party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a written offer of
compromise made by either party is not accepted by the other party within thirty (30) days after receipt and the party
not accepting such offer fails to obtain a more favorable judgment, the non-accepting party shall not be entitled to
recover its costs of suit and reasonable attorney's fees (even if it is the prevailing party) and shall be obligated to pay
the costs of suit and reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the offering party.
(8) With respect to any legal action or litigation arising out of or in connection with this Lease, the
parties hereby expressly waive any and all rights to a trial by jury. The parties acknowledge that the waiver of the
right to a trial by jury is a substantial relinquishment of a known right and it is the intent of the parties that the court to
be the sole arbiter of any legal action. The parties and the parties' Agents expressly waive any claims, whether in
contract, tort statute or otherwise, for judgment and/or to seek an award, for any claim for consequential, special,
diminution in value, punitive or similar-type damages.

  The base rental together with all adjustments thereof provided for herein shall be due and payable monthly in advance installments on the first day of each calendar month during the term, at the place and manner set forth in Section 4.01 hereof, without demand, deduction, abatement or setoff.  If the term ends on other than the last day of a calendar month, then the installment of base rental for such month shall be appropriately prorated.

       2.02. Additional Rent.  Tenant shall pay and discharge when the same shall become due, as “additional rent,” all amounts, liabilities and obligations which Tenant has assumed or agreed to pay or discharge pursuant to this Lease including without limitation those enumerated in this Article 2, and elsewhere in this Lease.  The term “rent” as used in this Lease shall mean and include all Minimum Rent, additional rent and other amounts payable by Tenant hereunder.

       2.03.  Taxes.  During the Term, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as additional rent included as part of CAM Costs (as defined below), Tenant’s Proportionate Share (as defined below) of the total general and special real estate taxes and assessments which are levied and assessed on the Building in which the Leased Premises are located (collectively, “Taxes”).  Tenant’s Proportionate Share of Taxes shall be paid in monthly installments on or before the first day of each calendar month, in advance, in an amount estimated by Landlord.  Upon receipt of all tax, assessment and expense bills attributable to any Lease Year, but no later than sixty (60) days following the end of each Lease Year, Landlord shall furnish Tenant with a written statement of the actual amount of Tenant’s Proportionate Share of Taxes. If the total amount paid by Tenant under this Section for any Lease Year shall be less than the actual amount due from Tenant for such Lease Year as shown on such statement, Tenant shall pay to Landlord the difference between the amount paid by Tenant and the actual amount due, such deficiency to be paid within thirty (30) days after written demand therefor by Landlord; and if the total amount paid by Tenant hereunder for any Lease Year shall exceed such actual amount due from Tenant for such Lease Year, such excess shall be credited against the payments hereunder next due, or if no payments are next due, promptly refunded to Tenant.  “Taxes” shall not include any of Landlord’s income, inheritance or gift taxes; excise or transfer taxes; franchise or “gross margins” taxes; capital levies or capital stock or excess profits taxes; rollback taxes attributable to any tax years prior to the year in which this Lease is executed due to a sale or change in the use of the Building by Landlord in such prior years; any items for which Tenant or other tenants are liable pursuant to the terms of their lease (other than as an expense pass through item); or penalties or any interest incurred for any reason whatsoever, including, without limitation, as a result of Landlord’s negligence, inability or unwillingness to make payments or, and/or to file any tax information or returns with respect to any real property taxes or assessments when due.  Tenant shall be entitled to its proportionate share of any real estate tax abatement for any Taxes related to the Building to ensure that tenant is only responsible to pay those Taxes that are actually assessed against and paid by Landlord.  “Tenant’s Proportionate Share” with respect to the Building is the fraction calculated by dividing the number of rentable square feet on space in the Leased Premises by the number of rentable square feet in the Building, which is __________ percent (____%).

       2.04. Insurance.  Landlord shall, during the Term, keep in full force and effect the insurance coverage required pursuant to Section 5.03 of this Lease.  The premiums charged Landlord for such insurance shall be included in the CAM Costs as provided in Section 2.05 below.

       2.05. CAM Costs.  Landlord shall provide Tenant with a written estimate CAM Costs for each Lease Year.

Within sixty (60) days following the end of each Lease Year, or as soon thereafter as practicable, Landlord shall provide Tenant with a written statement setting forth the actual CAM Costs for the preceding Lease Year.  If the actual CAM Costs exceed the estimated CAM Costs paid by Tenant, Tenant shall pay Tenant’s Proportionate Share of the difference to Landlord within thirty (30) days of Tenant’s receipt of said written statement.  If the estimated CAM Costs exceed the actual CAM Costs, Tenant shall be credited the difference toward the next payment of estimated CAM Costs, or if no payments are due, promptly refunded to Tenant.  Controllable CAM Costs (as hereinafter defined) assessable against Tenant shall not be increased by more than five percent (5%) per year over the remainder of the Term of this Lease, on a non-cumulative basis.  “Controllable CAM Costs” include all CAM Costs except for Taxes, utilities, property insurance and snow and ice removal.  During the first calendar year of this Lease Term, Tenant’s Proportionate Share of CAM Costs is estimated to be Two and 50/100 Dollars ($2.50) per rentable square foot per Lease Year.  “CAM Costs” shall include all actual costs and expenses incurred by Landlord in connection with maintaining and repairing the common areas of the Building, all premiums for all liability, property, and casualty insurance policies maintained by Landlord in connection with the Building, utility charges and other costs of lighting the common areas, removal of snow and ice, and collection and removal of trash from the Building and from any dumpsters provided by Landlord for the use of Tenants.  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, CAM Costs shall not include (i) depreciation and amortization of the Building or any equipment used or located therein; (ii) costs and expenses incurred in connection with leasing space in the Building, including real estate brokerage commissions; (iii) legal fees incurred in leasing or in disputes with tenants; (iv) capital expenditures; (v) cost of construction allowances provided to other tenants; (vi) interest or principal payments on any mortgage or deed of trust or any ground lease payments; (vii) any cost or expenditure for which Landlord is reimbursed (other than tax contributions or common area costs); (viii) costs of any services furnished to other tenants but which Landlord does not make available to Tenant; (ix) cost of repairs or maintenance caused or necessitated by the negligence of Landlord, its agents, contractors or employees; (x) costs recoverable by Landlord pursuant to its insurance policies; (xi) insurance costs on any other tenant’s space, whether vacant or occupied; or (xii) costs of any code compliance work, including compliance with the Americans With Disability Act.
